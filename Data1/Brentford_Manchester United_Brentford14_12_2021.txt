So Manchester united team got covid and they‚Äôve cancelled their match with Brentford. I‚Äôm low key happy cus God knows I didn‚Äôt want to get up from my bed.



With regards to the covid situation, I understand why the PL wanted out game v Brentford to go ahead. Having the opening game cancelled due to covid was going to be a very bad look.

United have called of their game against Brentford tonight due to Fred, McTominay, Maguire, Sancho and Shaw all testing negative for Covid.



Genuine question, how have Manchester United had their match vs Brentford postponed for COVID Cases but, Aston Villa who have also had cases still have to play their match vs Norwich?

Surely the risk is exactly the same, even if the number of cases is different?
