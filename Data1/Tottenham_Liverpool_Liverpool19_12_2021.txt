There could be a lot of Cancelo VCers this weekend, so I'm hoping Salah starts for Liverpool today, or even comes on as a substitute. I don't want to share these Cancelo points. 😂



Dele Alli, Harry Winks and Tanguy Ndombele all start for Tottenham. Giovani Lo Celso back on the bench but no Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg in the squad.

At Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for Spurs v Liverpool. https://t.co/MTrUnkiGDw



So now we've had Arsenal where shirt pulling isn't a pen, Liverpool where a head injury is played on, Leicester where a pen is given after a dive and Man City where a pen is not given after a wiped out.

Just relegate #NUFC now the officials are just taking the p*ss



No Thiago or Henderson for Liverpool today.#coys #thfc #TOTLIV #lfc



Have to be cautiously, perhaps even ridiculously optimistic about a result today. Spurs' form doesn't compare to Liverpool's, but Spurs have rested and can only get better, and still have great players who can get it on. That or I'm still trying to live life to the full! #coys

Liverpool not playing with their midfield 🤧🤧🤧



I just want Spurs/Liverpool to be a good game, might be the last Prem game without fans (sorry trying not to be negative) &amp; I just want a game that is still alive in the last 10 minutes.



People need to realise there is a bigger gap between Man City and Liverpool then there is between the bottom 6-8 and league 1. We have done ok in the last 2 games. Mistakes have cost us a couple of goals and some horrendous ref decisions. #nufc



OFFICIAL: Liverpool have confirmed that Thiago will miss the game against Spurs due to a suspected positive COVID-19 test.

Jordan Henderson also misses out through non-COVID-related illness.

We should have in my opinion



I get that with all the injuries to the squad and the run of fixtures that we’ve had, we weren’t likely to get much of anything from them, but the ease at which we are being cut apart and amount of goals being conceded is ridiculous. Liverpool will do a Man City on us. #lufc



To be fair liverpool only scored in the 94th minute against this wolves side, they are a good side.

No tempo. No desire. Its like they don’t care that City and Liverpool are opening a gap again.



🚨 CONFIRMED: No Van Dijk, Fabinho, Henderson or Thiago for Liverpool today. [Liverpool Website]



There is no way we win the league this year with the piss poor performances we have had as of late unfortunately. Only possible way is if we find our form fast and City and Liverpool have their own small blip of form but I doubt it



City literally has zero competition unless Liverpool FC does not challenge them.

How poetic that working class hero’s are the only ones that can stand up against any one no matter how wealthy they are



At least Man City are the ones winning the league, I don’t really care about them. If Liverpool won I’d be bothered. 
God forbid United win the title again one day, I’ll vomit blood.



LIKE for our Spurs v Liverpool card bets!



i wouldn't be shocked if liverpool drop points today. gotta be discouraging watching this and knowing before christmas that you're finishing second in the league.

Premier League more like Farmers League!Man City &amp; Liverpool are just on another level &amp; have been last 4 years!



We’re still cursed against Liverpool https://t.co/sH7Y8ypefl

Easy win. I can already taste the Liverpool fans' tears.

"but but we didn't have Van Dijk and Henderson 😢"

Shut up, no one cares. https://t.co/9OWClIUcHG



Everyone excited for the Liverpool lineup?



James Pearce when asked about transfers this January:
"As things stand I’m not expecting Liverpool to reinforce the squad in January."

#LFC 🔴 https://t.co/IoT9GZo1JK



City &amp; Liverpool absolute levels above the rest of the league. 

The difference between them and the big “6” is huge to never mind the likes of Newcastle, Burnley etc. 

Playing them is a game to try not to concede a load to damage ya goal difference



Anyone from #Liverpool or beyond saying “I remember the Higsons beer mats” yet??? I’m sort of guessing they were around over 40 years ago? https://t.co/UQImM3vcYo



The Reds will be without Jordan Henderson due to a non-Covid related illness today. In addition, Thiago Alcantrana will miss today's match due to a positive Covid-19 test. Wishing a speedy recovery to both. 

#Liverpool #LFC #YNWA #Anfield



The Liverpool and Tottenham game would be something if Liverpool lose. #NEWMCI



Manchester City are currently steamrolling this division, sending a message to title rivals Liverpool, saying “catch us if you can”. 

Purring. Ruthless. Dominant. 

#NEWMCI



Liverpool’s first choice midfield 3 of Fabinho, Thiago and Henderson are all missing today.



Will be very difficult for Liverpool today at Spurs without  VVD, Jones, Fabinho, Thiago &amp; Henderson.



Surely Liverpool should think about postponing a game when they have no midfield?



Of course covid is taking out Liverpool’s best players first. Makes sense.



Playing Liverpool, City and Leicester is hard enough against 11 men - playing against 12 in all 3 games is impossible @SBRFoundation @NUFC



Cancel this Liverpool game .. wtf



No Fabinho, no Hendo, no Thiago. Big test for the Liverpool midfield today. This club has an uncanny habit of creating new heroes in trying situations though. Exciting!



Madness that Liverpool arnt milking this covid like other teams with only 1 case. Were missing key players here



Klopp can't aff9rd to rake chances with so many Liverpool players suffering from Asthma. https://t.co/q2ymJ5MNSf

I know we could put two and two together but why are Liverpool naming the players out with Covid ? Don't think any other club bar Chelsea have ?



3-0 City Liverpool will be watching now necking same capsules and wanting to match there score or better it 👁no



Man City could top the table by 4 points today if Tottenham don’t “TOTTENHAM” the game against Liverpool 😂
#TOTLIV

#LFC 

https://t.co/3VBruwTd4K



Crazy how rumoured line-ups on here can move Liverpool from 1.60 to 1.90 to 1.73



Man City are too good aren’t they. Liverpool will chase them but they’re clear for me.



I mean this genuinely and not in some ironic, Liverpool are fucked moaning way. Next few midfields will be fun. Milner/Keita/Ox today? Tyler Morton against Leeds? Fun and games https://t.co/nRqxd3Lwld



Liverpool need to absolutely clinical today.

They will get chances to score, they just have to taken them. There will be times when the midfield won’t be able to cope with Spurs and that’s when #LFC will be vulnerable.

#TOTLIV



This Liverpool team today without the first choice midfield reminds me of when Kurt Angle joined The SHIELD 🤣 https://t.co/3OjEn1Jg7I



The weather in Berlin is so pissy, I think I’ll have to go the pub to watch Liverpool Vs Spurs



Its a joke that Liverpool are agreeing to play this game.



This Chelsea game is slow. I blame Wolves for this. It felt like this when I watched wolves play Liverpool and Man City. Wolves should win this one #WolChe



Another City and Liverpool.
Hope that the Olesexuals are happy with that, that's on your head.



Why are Chelsea and Liverpool even playing today. Just postpone the league!!!! @premierleague



Liverpool win https://t.co/ERM8kFbMVE



what does it take for liverpool to have their game postponed is it fair we play without vvd , fabinho , thiago or henderson ??? is it really fair because if we lose points today i think we should close this league because thats like having 4 main players injured



Why is it teams bend over backwards for Man City but turn into prime Barcelona when playing Liverpool?



Man City, Liverpool and Arsenal are busy winning games while Chelsea FC is busy playing like a 2nd division team... Kiss the EPL title goodbye 👋 ... hehehe 😄🤣😂 #WolChe https://t.co/9dsneKwtpL

Yh this season is either City’s or Liverpool’s man



Why is everyone getting excited for Dele against Liverpool today???

Tell me the last time the guy had a great game and it excited you because I'll tell you the last time i enjoyed watching Alli was in the 3-1 win over Chelsea THREE YEARS ago

The guys finished, stop hyping him



Chelsea still not on the level of City and Liverpool



entirety of liverpool squad either positive for covid or suspecting to be positive or has some other mysterious illness . how fun.



Mahrez is our top scorer but probs isnr top 5 here. If he is was at Liverpool theyd lawd him. We know goals arent everythinf



It’s a Liverpool FC outbreak. Not only is it unfair for the  @premierleague to not postpone this game when others have been, it’s also bloody irresponsible! https://t.co/Da2eL7K888

Jordan Henderson also misses out through non-COVID-related illness.



Salah with a 2nd minute pen and Bobby to score an 89th minute header. Game will end 2-0 to Liverpool.



Spurs v Liverpool and Giants v Cowboys.  My squads have their work cut out for them today.  #coys #gmen



Swear some Liverpool fans talk about Man City more than Liverpool.



🔴 Thiago is the fourth Liverpool player to test positive for COVID-19, so misses today's game.

The club have confirmed Jordan Henderson is also out due to illness, but tested negative. https://t.co/won1nLcw0v



My PTSD of Liverpool has many causes, but this is the worst https://t.co/6WlIPNUr5O



With ONLY goals scored by Mohamed Salah, Liverpool would still be third in the Premier League and have a positive goal difference!!! #LFC



Gerrard has been admitted to the Liverpool squad today.



Thiago out is good for us; been so influential for Liverpool in recent weeks

With the nonsense Chelsea are playing no wonder Tuchel requested the match be postponed. He knew he can't deal with the Wolves threat. Thought y'all said you had squad depth? You don't know what squad you have till you lose just 1 key player not even 5. Ask City and Liverpool

City have already played their 2 hardest games of the season at Anfield and Stamford Bridge. They got 4 points out of 6 and were the better team in both. I think a lot will depend on how Liverpool come to the Etihad.

He could barely walk against Liverpool Thursday night.

Liverpool must be buzzing hearing Dele Alli is starting against them today 🤣



Us Liverpool fans have to defend Trent against bums like AWB, Reece, Cancelo etc. on constant basis even tho nobody has been performing on Trent’s level for past 3-4 season. Our players will never get the respect they deserve loool

Jurgen Klopp took charge of Liverpool for his first game as manager 2,255 days ago in a 0-0 draw with Spurs.
He's recorded 200 wins in that time. #LFC



Defending is awful but overall we have been ok as we were against Liverpool. However when you are down there, you need the decisions to be right. Standard of refereeing absolutely disgraceful 😡 #nufc



It’s December and I haven’t seen one Christmas tweet, my timeline is just full of Liverpool or Spider-Man. Great times



Liverpool and Spurs, a great classic before Christmas.



Chelsea best XI IMO.
Mendy
RJ
Chilwell*
Silva
AC*
Jorginho*
Kova *
Kante
Havertz*
Lukaku*
Mount

6 of our best XI are injured or not 100%. Of course we'll struggle.

Take the equivalent players from City, Liverpool or United and see how that goes.

We need to see this though.



Incase Chelsea fans are feeling like this is the worst period of the season, don't forget the fact that we are starting the new year with a game vs Liverpool and Anthony Taylor is the referee. #WolChe

Wolves aren't weak man city wins with penalty goal, Liverpool won with final kick goal. So basically Chelsea in mud right now

Think the PL bosses hate Newcastle more than Liverpool now.



Manchester city with all their attacking big boys (cancelo sterling Bernardo etc) struggled against wolves

Liverpool with salah Trent jota mane Robertson also struggled 

It’d be a miracle if this depleted Chelsea come out of this with anything

Liverpool fans called VVD best in the league's history for less than half of what Cancelo is doing now

I have worked it out #NUFC fans, if your name is Fraser you won’t be awarded a penalty!! 
Liverpool ❌
Manchester City ❌

Absolute joke!!!!!!! 🤯



Damn, I was wrong thinking this Chelsea team would run away with the league. Once their maestro Jorginho not playing, they look pretty bang average for a supposed title challenger. My money on City now, but Liverpool will definitely put up a strong fight

Liverpool will have to be on their B game vs Spurs.

i dont think we need to let go of 2nd gear, Spurs defensive structure can easily be bypassed, Conte hasn't had enough time to make them a defensive power house. If they intent to attack us, that would be suicide.



We can only hope Conte is trying to trick everyone into thinking he’s gonna play the shittest midfield in Tottenham history against Liverpool and then say ha fooled ya and bring out Hojbjerg and Skipp last minute

There's no way in hell that Chelsea can match City and Liverpool no way. The league is now so competitive that you need both an Elite Squad and an Elite Manager to challenge. Chelsea have an elite manager but their squad is still a way off from the top two.



Very questionable refereeing so far this morning. Expect everything to go against Liverpool today.



Me knowing that Man City &amp; Liverpool have Cancelo &amp; Trent whilst we are stuck with Booker T at RB 
 https://t.co/1XLayZfmF0



Liverpool actually scouted, bought and used competent left backs — because Manchester City failed to do the same, João Cancelo is now better than Trent because of versatility. 

Bulletproof logic.

SHOT!  Liverpool work the ball forward to Aguva, who cuts on to his right and curls one over the bar.



City set a Premier League record in that half - the most Premier League goals in a calendar year.

They're now on 104, overtaking  their own record of 102 in 2017. Liverpool were the last top flight team to score more (106) in 1982. #mcfc



Not sure Antonio Conte is going to send out the expansive style team people think against Liverpool. Seeing lots of offers for +3.5gls etc but can see it being a lot tighter than that.

Match day today. Tottenham vs Liverpool. What’s your take.



Chelsea half time thoughts - 

- Everything looks a bit messy.
- Tuchel clearly annoyed and players annoyed as well.
- Wolves are tough to break down Liverpool and City showed that.

Need a way better second half, and a bit of luck for Chelsea to win.



No, this is not the point at all. Chelsea are absolutely in the same bracket as Liverpool and City but are simply really unfortunate that Lukaku has been injured for 7 games this season and now they have a COVID crisis. Chelsea are elite tactically and player-wise everywhere. https://t.co/uW0rsL4qXK

Liverpool might be in impressive form, but @bchinop sees value in fading the Reds against Tottenham:

https://t.co/La1pNJL2Lb



Chelsea Fans : Reece James &gt; TAA

Liverpool Fans : Nope Trent is better 

City Fans : said nothing just look👇🏾👇🏾 https://t.co/4fswOHUZqU



#NikujaribuTu Tottenham 3-1 Liverpool



#WolChe Chelsea's players are utterly obsessed with passing the ball backwards. Look at City-Liverpool they win the ball they look to see who's ahead.
Chelsea are lost while they obsess over ball retention rather than seeing attack opportunity.

Klopp’s pressing structure is better than City. Newcastle could hardly build up an attack against Liverpool. They are doing it with relative ease against Man City.



Tottenham vs Liverpool. live today!!!

#tottenham #liverpool #epl #premiereleague https://t.co/gqxQCGywd6



We havent been great...but then again we're no worse than liverpool (and especially chelsea) are every week. They still win. We're winning now

"If a player is not vaccinated at all, he is a constant threat for all of us," says Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp #LFC 

https://t.co/NDtbvjch5z



If Liverpool don’t win later today, it’s clear this season is going to Man City again. Chelsea asked to postpone the game due to COVID and PL said no. We’re playing with barely no bench. Some real sketchy stuff always benefits City, it’s amazing 

#WOLCHE #PremierLeague

Finding ways to give teams the lead is a sure sign of relegation and you can see that defence is where the majority of the January money needs to go. 

I wasn’t expecting anything from Liverpool or City games - but there are some real signs of life in the team. #nufc

Just rewatched the #LEEARS game.
We have a system that suits KP, but when he’s out we try to replace him rather than starting with a formation that suits the actual team selected.
Against Liverpool we NEED to be solid from the back &amp; DM. Grind out a boring point if needed. #LUFC



Lol when Arsenal boys play well against teams other fan base say those teams are weak or out of form. Well last I checked the only strong teams in the league currently are Man city and Liverpool. 

Give the boys their kudos for good performances and stop being envious abeg.

With all these decisions going in particular man city's way good as they are I do not think they are better than Liverpool but I do think the referees give them a slight advantage.

Spurs vs Liverpool ticket available



More stats: 
♦️ Firmino &amp; Salah both have 5 league goals against Spurs, 1 fewer than Robbie Fowler’s PL best for the club of six.

♦️ A goal today would see Firmino become the first Liverpool player in history to score in four successive league games against Spurs.

Got a train into Liverpool. No trains leaving the city. Got a train back to Birkenhead. Got a lift down the motorway with a friend to Altrincham. Tram into Manchester. Now I wait for a train that may or may not exist to Marsden. I am too stressed.



Liverpool and Man City are the only teams on the premier league that would get away with that. If that had been in the Newcastle box, guarantee penno.

Tottenham vs Liverpool still scheduled to go ahead amid rising Covid cases and postponements

https://t.co/qaGg9XKOhP



This is one of the problems with covid. City appear to have everyone available therefore. Liverpool have 3 players out with rumoured Thiago and Salah out. Chelsea have to play Chalobah in MF. Spurs squad will struggle due to half having covid and united not even playing.



Manchester City and Liverpool deserve their own league.



Tottenham vs Liverpool still scheduled to go ahead amid rising Covid cases and postponements

https://t.co/aBmuSqgCH3



fucking hell thats even more of a penalty than the one they weren't given against liverpool 😂



Two nil down already, and it seems like only yesterday that we were being thumped by Liverpool.



Liverpool fans: 
TAA is the best RB in the world 

Cancelo: Hold my beer again



Once Man City starts making it look easy like this, forget about your title chances. If Liverpool allows City to pull away tonight it’s done.



How is that not a penalty?  Its 1 rule for City and Liverpool another for everyone else. This is a joke, its every week

why r our fans mentioning trent blud , city r playing rn not liverpool ffs



Nah everyone’s too obsessed with Liverpool, Cancelo is maaaaaaad



Man City definitely winning now. I hope Liverpool drop points man. 🙏



Cancelo saw Trent’s goal vs Liverpool and said aight bet



Let me not go too hard on Newcastle cos we're about to get packed in by Liverpool a little later.



Some people really think Trent is better than Cancelo, just shows how deluded Liverpool fans are 😭

⚪️ Dele Alli is reportedly set to start his first game for Spurs under Antonio Conte against Liverpool.

🤔 Is anyone backing him at 4/1 to get on the score sheet? #TOTLIV https://t.co/YoMLMw0Dfo



Won’t be shocked if Conte goes for a 3412/352 esc formation with dele as a 10 behind Kane and ?  Allows for a 532 in defense too which is big v Liverpool imo



Normally Spurs vs Liverpool would have me excited but right now I’m not sure I even give a shit.



Liverpool have TAA and Robertson, City have Cancelo while we have Wan Bissaka https://t.co/NLad16I5Ik

I knew and told everyone’s Chelsea wouldn’t be in a serious title race. Nowadays, winning games marginally every week isn’t ‘the sign of champions’ due to how good Liverpool and City are. You need to be extraordinary in and out of possession. Chelsea lack offensively at times.

Also they were unlucky against Liverpool, Man City, Man Utd.

Expect spurs to be rock solid at the back. Very comfortable with not having the ball. Conte’s team never allow spaces. Liverpool will have to work the ball well and be cautious about counter attacks.

A full City side needed a dubious panalty to beat Wolves. A full Liverpool side needed a 94th lucky break to win. 
Chelsea ravaged by Covid and injuries with half fit players starting and only one proper outfield player on the bench (who has not played for weeks btw) must win. Hm



Quite incredible how Man City and Liverpool seem to be the only squads to avoid Covid positives.



im back in liverpool and everything seems the same



Salah on the bench. EFL in few days for Liverpool so resting him for that? #FPL



Salah has covid. Odds on the Liverpool games getting called off until he is back??

Need Liverpool to batter Spurs later on today



It must be really frustrating for managers like Eddie Howe to come up against Liverpool and Man City in a matter of 3 days. Really feel for him watching his pre match interview ahead of the City game



Can Jamie redknapp ever make a comment without mentioning liverpool fc?



Tottenham 1 ~0 Liverpool.



No salah for Liverpool

Honestly can’t wait to see how we fuck this up today. 

We literally never play well against Liverpool (except for that one time at Wembley when Lovren had to retire) 

Praying for a Conte masterclass but feel our defence is too weak and attack is blunt. #COYS



🚨 Liverpool are looking to land Salah’s contract before he leaves at the start of January #LFC https://t.co/gT4fPNlBFS



Wolves have been so unlucky against top teams. Played quite well but ended up losing by just 1 goal and some of them coming in final minutes too. Lost 1-0 to united, spurs, Liverpool, city and Leceister. Today they can turn it around vs Chelsea. UP WOLVES.



Liverpool ❤️ It’s too cold though 🥶 https://t.co/ml95kC40lR



This is a bold prediction but 6-0 to Liverpool

Reminded of United's 5-1 defeat to Liverpool. 

No direction. No ideas.



I was encouraged by our performance at Liverpool. We didn’t fear them, we had a go for the whole 90. I’m liking Howe’s no-fear mentality and interested how we go into this game. Let’s get stuck in &amp; give them a game

Won 3-2 today which takes us 3 points clear with a game in hand. Slow first half 0-0 went 3 nil up with 15 to play, but like true champions @derby_park didn't stop and made it an uncomfortable last few minutes. 

100% record at Xmas ✅

The best thing about playing liverpool is my dads reactions(liverpool fan) usually when they score he jumps up screaming his head off dancing around. When they score against spurs he’s radio silent to try not annoy me more 😂😂



So it seems virtually every other club get a nice Xmas break at the busiest time of the year whilst Liverpool and Chelsea plough through even though both teams have key players missing due to Covid. You have to question the integrity of the competition

Maybe he impressed Conte in training over the last week or so? He doesn't seem the type of manager to play a player to get him in the shop window, especially against Liverpool.



Liverpool and Man. City are dominating without needing loads of goals from their center forwards. Can Chelsea's front men deliver what Lukaku and Werner can't? Without the goals, can Lukaku and Werner do what the likes of Firmino do? Creat them?

He also said he sent "Jorgi home". No manager wants to inflict misery on himself, there's definitely more to this, we need to exercise patience before we start scapegoating as usual. City and Liverpool have a fully fit squad, it's hard to compete with a Covid stricken squad.

Massive home game today for #Spurs after a mini break. Always seem to loose to Liverpool by 1/2 goals. Either being a Pen or OG and of course the annual Firmino goal, every game that bloke scores against us. I’ll be optimistic for sure but they one hard team to beat the mo #COYS

We're playing 26th and 28 December with 14 players against Aston villa and Brighton. Then playing Liverpool on the second.

Chelsea fans are suddenly comparing their injury crisis to Liverpool’s last season.

Lool. You’ve not even lost any key player for the entire season yet.

But this is what happens when you try to make excuse for winning the league in November rather than December.

Nonsense.



City and Liverpool must be hoping for more dropped points for Chelsea today. They must be secretly jubilant over the ravages from Covid and injuries.



Newcastle have deep pockets and big ambition but they are flat bottom of the league and looking at relegation. Against Liverpool they offered nothing going forward, aside from a couple Shelvey long shots and a Thiago back pass. ASM was isolated and lacked the strength for CF.



This is still a decent starting 11 tbh, 1 decent sub. They moving like Liverpool dkm https://t.co/i3LvQbMEnJ

At some point a club will bring players back early from covid to fulfil a key fixture. It will become apparent that the players are overly fatigued and it’s potentially dangerous. Answers on a postcard as to when that might be? (Tottenham Hotspur 0 Liverpool 11)

Klopp reveals big Liverpool news over latest Mo Salah contract talks https://t.co/BAAyGOsuxA



The driver was reported after being pulled over by police
https://t.co/Wwx7lLS8Mo



15 points from my 3 #FPL players yesterday and my 5 players in the 2pm kick off all start so I just need the Liverpool game to go ahead to field a full team in this crazy week without taking a hit



I'd rather play a decent Liverpool side today, but on the other hand it would be nice to play a weakened side. https://t.co/cG40NIAMBn



Mxa I hate Utd and Liverpool pundits



Won't happen to Liverpool https://t.co/aq3xlw9rbz



Wolves are beating Chelsea 2-1
City are beating Newcastle 5-0
Liverpool are beating spurs 3-0



What enjoyment do you get from posting these Spurs Liverpool fixture moments??? Do you how much time I spend on meditation and mindfulness to overcome each one of these fuck ups?????
