People are panicking a lot about who has COVID, but I believe Norwich are missing their first choice centre backs, so they're not at full strength either regardless. They look much better under Smith (more competitive at least), but definitely winnable.

“Aston Villa won 5-1 in their last away league game against Norwich in October 2019”



Tonight will be a good test of our character under SG. Brighton, palace and Leicester were games that were expected to be close. Pool/City were freebies. Tonight we expect to beat Norwich. It will be interesting to see how we set up in these games now. Up the Villa #AVFC



Score Predictions for today’s games:

Norwich City 1-1 Aston Villa
Man City 2-0 Leeds United

#PL



Looking for 1 for Norwich in Trevor Brooking upper 
As close to 222 as possible

Hope we have a dominant performance tonight where we just brush Norwich aside 3-0. 

Would love to see the villa from this time last year back where we just did teams over.



Predictions for today’s games:
Norwich 0-2 Villa 
City 4-1 

Thoughts?



Despite how we played against Norwich I was still looking forward to the Brentford match ffs.



📈 Supporting info:

• Watkins has 3 goals in his last 7 games
• Mahrez should return to XI to provide fresh legs

I think us Everton fans on here should count our blessings we aren’t Norwich fans. 

Imagine the mental health problems we would all have and car park fights arranged, as we win the championship every 2 years,  but lose nearly every game of the season in between!

If anyone was considering Watkins I’d just watch for a few reasons
• Hes never shafted vs Norwich with since Gerrard took over

i think i've learned three things this year:

1. fuck norwich
2. fuck plymouth
3. fuck cardiff



If Ollie Watkins hits the woodwork against Norwich after i brought him in after last season’s shenanigans there will be no one on this Earth that will be able to convince me that FPL isnt just a simulation for shithousery.

Can't sell Ronaldo and then buy him back as I don't have the money, after the weekend price rise. That's a shame as Watkins should get something against Norwich. So I'm thinking Jansson to a Villa defender, as they have Norwich and Burnley and can then sit on the bench.

Genuine question, how have Manchester United had their match vs Brentford postponed for COVID Cases but, Aston Villa who have also had cases still have to play their match vs Norwich?

Surely the risk is exactly the same, even if the number of cases is different?

Always felt this. His best spell for #MUFC reserves, seniors &amp; the few good games for Norwich this year have all come on the left. Most of his poor games in his career have come on the right.

Of course ManUnited are the only club able to still fill a matchday squad despite their covid cases,but get their requested postponement and schedule advantage.Unlike Norwich,Arsenal and Brentford themselves,who played with abscenties.

Carrington was temporarily closed back in February for a deep clean when we had a COVID "outbreak" so, if they have done that again this time, the first team could logically return to training tomorrow — as it was reported that ALL of the Norwich travelling squad tested negative. https://t.co/jbuZgRCHGv



Norwich had 6 players out with covid the other day, did they cry to the PL or just get on with it? That's what we are dealing with here. Lower standards than Norwich.

It’s a bit of a loss take. United only have 3-4 players with Covid. Arsenal had to play with that, as did we, Norwich and other teams. I don’t understand why United have got special treatment here



If the United squad  were infected with Covid before the Norwich game, it would explain a terrible performance.

I think unless they change Rafa @jasoncundy05 @Everton are going down, would like to ask the question is Benitez the only manager with a CL and a relegation on his CV. I actually think Norwich are better than them toffees, if they had a decent forward they would be ok.

Ridiculous it is taking this long. Just over 24 hours to kick off now. What about the travelling fans with trains and hotels booked etc? If United haven’t been able to train properly since Norwich and there’s positive cases, it seems a straightforward decision. https://t.co/NWEHIfEWQj

For example - I thought the one on Ronaldo was a penalty.

But with 15 minutes to go, is that given for Norwich against Man Utd? No chance. 

Unless it's stonewall, the cowardly ref isn't going to risk the inevitable media backlash they'd face. 

Like I say, there's the problem.



Football scorers - football is about &gt;1 goals:
Man City: Top scorer 9, 2nd 7, 3rd 6. 4th= 5. 6th= 3, 9th= 2 [total 12 scorers]
Arsenal: Top scorer  7, 2nd  6, 3rd= 4, 5th 3, 6= 2, [total 7 scorers];
Norwich: Top scorer  5. 2nd 2, 3rd 2: [total 3 scorers]   
Tells us everything



Norwich, Burnley, Watford are getting relegated (or Southampton). And those are the “right” teams to. Newcastle gonna scrape safety thanks to loan and transfer deals that will improve them enough I assume.
