Chelsea football club. Happy for the game against Everton at home to go ahead despite Everton ravaged by injury and illness. Today, they want the game against Wolves away called off. Let's pick and choose when we want to play based on whether we think we can win. Pathetic



Be a horrid cold day at Wolves today for Chelsea plus thyre hit with covid... fancy wolves to take somethin

Ei Wolves way dey make me nervous like this ?



Also one other thing, the Premier League should make every team vaccinate if they love their precious league that much - look at Wolves for example, in the summer they went as a squad to get vaccinated (100% vaccinated) and now have 0 Covid cases



It is now being reported that #Chelsea requested that their PL game at Wolves today be postponed. The obviously corrupt @premierleague rejected Chelsea's request. That should tell you all you need to know why CFC will not be allowed to win the title this season.



Didn't he just test negative recently and was declared fit to play vs Wolves ? Tf is going on. https://t.co/vmNQxaJO2p

Premier League 'reject Chelsea's request to postpone Wolves clash' https://t.co/IyPkjUuu1R via @MailSport



Chelsea's request to have today's game against Wolves postponed has been rejected by the Premier League: 

"We are deeply disappointed that our application was rejected as we felt we had a strong case for postponement of the match on the grounds of players’ health and safety."



Do any Wolves players have covid



I don’t know about you but I really think that ‘in the hall of the mountain king’ really slaps.



Chelsea with 7 covid cases and injuries request their match against wolves be postponed. FA a*sholes said NO. There is a campaign against Chelsea. Its Chelsea vs the world.



The last time Chelsea lost consecutive away league games was in December last year, a run of three which included a defeat at Wolves.
#WolChe https://t.co/Jh9AKSryjk



#CFC left "deeply disappointed" that their application to have today's game at Wolves postponed was rejected by the Premier League. 

"We felt we had a strong case for the postponement of today's match on the grounds of players’ health and safety."

“This follows two players being confirmed as positive cases yesterday, with another testing positive for COVID-19 overnight.”

“..they could be forced to field a team who are lacking match fitness.”

This isn’t fair competition, it’s the COVID lottery.

https://t.co/3CJPJdiR4i



So if Chelsea have 14 available players for today's match against Wolves and Saul and Kepa are on the bench that means only one other player will not be in the starting lineup.



Every club registers the same number of players on PL lists. Only one club is playing through an ongoing COVID outbreak. Some players had COVID while playing against Everton and it will be the same against Wolves. 
The integrity of the league is undeniably compromised.



all wolves are still stanky

Why did they reject Chelsea's proposal to postpone the game against Wolves?



Predicted Chelsea XI 🖲

v Wolves (my opinion)

• Rumour is we’ve requested the game to be postponed (Rejected)

• Rumour of 3 fresh covid cases (unsure who) 

• Genuinely think we will see Chalobah in the middle.

• Confident of the front 3. The rest was tricky.

Wolves are definitely beating us



I knew they wouldn’t call the game off. The agenda against Chelsea is very real. So we have no recognised striker again, our two best wingbacks are out, our midfield brain (Jorginho) is out, CHO is out. All that and we still have to play against a tough Wolves side 😕 https://t.co/TDJFciuAqw



wolves do u thing https://t.co/wbpEoChLMb



We depend on Wolves.



Buzzing for the away fans up at at wolves but where’s the consistency? Other teams have less players out but they make us play. Premier league really don’t want us to succeed.

Chelsea have shot themselves in the foot recently against Burnley, United, West Ham and Everton. We should have far more points than we do which would have eased the current situation of the squad. But we have no chance getting points against Wolves, our squad is decimated



Choices of football today. Do I want to watch:
Liverpool beat Tottenham 3-0,
Chelsea beat Wolves 4-0 or
Man City beat Newcastle 8-0?
Can we just award the points and move on?

You included Saul and you think we would beat Wolves 😂 https://t.co/OepcUclnUn



How does that help us beat Wolves? https://t.co/pRPBoVSOcc



Well done Wolves. Hope you win today https://t.co/djBsA7n3fz



Pump on Wolves today. Chelsea will not be returning back to London with 3 points. Yet (somehow) still odds-on.



all wolves are always odorous



Premier League rejects Chelsea’s request to postpone today’s match against Wolves.

I find this inconsistency difficult to understand. More importantly, I find the lack of appreciation of the gravitas of the pandemic on the part of @premierleague extremely alarming &amp; disturbing😳



The fact we clearly have an outbreak in the squad that is still developing and others could have it but not yet testing positive and will play and potentially spread it around the wolves squad as well is madness



Chelsea VS Wolves will be played after their request to postpone the game was denied 🚨
#FPLCommunity



Lmao, just saw someone put the best available CFC XI &amp; say that team should be enough to beat Wolves today. 

No mention of lack of subs, no mention that Trev, Kante &amp; Kova will need to play 90 having been out for ages. No mention that Wolves had extra day of rest &amp; are in form

Wolves have to get at least a point https://t.co/eSmRO7EOMv



Carry Wolves straight win.



On top of all the injuries we have, they're making us play today against wolves with 7 or 8 COVID cases in our squad, I guess this Premier League campaign is in shambles now... #WOLCHE #EPL



I get it we want to see CHELSEA play and games not called off. But use your brains. Countless players out against Wolves at Molineux is a recipe for disaster. Watch more injuries build up today too. Farce.

Forget covid, the PL will now just pick and choose what they want



I'd rather surround myself with ten wolves in a time of battle thn a hunnid niggas that move like sheep



Reading the Box of Delights and it's interesting that some of the wolves have the bodies of motor cars and planes. Given that the Box opens the way to the past, I wonder if Masefield was gently encouraging his readers to be cautious about both nostalgia and technological progress

Can we cancel the match if the score is 2-0 to wolves at half-time??? #WolChe #Chelsea



Good. Their squad is about 7 times the size of Wolves’ https://t.co/cdTt329uVf



The fact here’s even a debate about whether Chelsea v Wolves is on it not less than 2 1/2 hours before kickoff is a failure in and of itself



I am told Chelsea-Wolves is still on as it stands. 

My reading of the situation is that the status is quite fragile due to new Covid cases in the Blues squad. Tuchel likely to confirm player names ahead of kick-off, should the match go ahead. #CFC



Feel for the fans travelling to Wolves today with no idea if game going ahead or not. If it doesn’t, make sure you still have a great day out 🍻

I'm hearing Wolves v Chelsea is back on ✅



Wolves are a pretty solid defensive team, and will probably rely heavily on counter attacks. If we can’t finish our chances like we did against Everton then I can’t see us getting more than 1 point today



Considering our away form Chelsea needs to up their game against strong wolves home defence. Otherwise I see a draw game here



...The bleak wind, the corpses on the ground, the screams under the stars... I smell them all, the scent of wolves. I shall join the hunt.



A campaign where Jacket has to run from the Ghost Wolves.



wolves just need to admit that they are always stinky



The game kicks off at 2pm.

Got to the point now where Chelsea fans are wishing covid on their own team to get the game called off! Madness. They have one of the strongest squads in the league. As a Wolves fan, I love nothing more than match day, regardless of our squad availability. Strange. https://t.co/4dd8SqujRV

One says; yea you know maybe i don't really need to be so harsh on my art a lot... I do what i can and honestly i should just do this for fun :]

The Other goes; nah lol fuck art welp time to post memes haha

Into the den: Wolves vs Chelsea https://t.co/AYJHbBYKRH



Wolves game to to be called off by 12.30 is my prediction. Morning test results should be in, Chelsea to appeal to the Pl for game to be called off, PL bend over for one of the big clubs and fans get shafted who are on their way up. Repeat each week now until March.



Two main fancies of the weekend run today. Combine them for a 5/1 double.

Can’t see Wolves offering too many quality chances to Chelsea, who are having finishing issues anyway.

And, Martin Atkinson. The king of low cards. Simple.

It would be so chelsea to blow wolves out of the water out of nowhere with Saul on the scoresheet

But it would be equally chelsea to get whacked 4-1 and Tuchel’s sacked by Christmas morning

Ah, the life of a Chelsea fan in the beautiful winter month of December

Of course you should run wolves with Asses. You should dark everything with soldiers.



I forgot to mention what the wolves do. Uh- don't look at them.



I make that 7 Chelsea players with covid now? Going to Wolves to watch Traore bang in a hat-trick then 🤔



I try to see the wolves in my mind's eye, but I can only imagine them. I wish I could describe them to you. My father's voice had trailed off. Will I tell my grandchildren, I wonder, of animals they will never see?

Onto Wolves…probably get there and have to get back straight away the way things are going…



Magnus waited until the wolves turned away with reluctant grunts, the runt of the pack sending him a look that very much read 'you've lost your mind'.

Minnesota had a +14 advantage in offensive rebounds (15-1) that led to them dominating the Lakers in 2nd Chance Points, 23-4.

T'Wolves were also +16 in paint points. Key indicators that they were the much more physical team yesterday.

The Wolves had two power plays in a row and couldn't make anything happen. 

The second of the two was full of high energy and good looks but Connor Ingram was not going to allow anything to get past him.
