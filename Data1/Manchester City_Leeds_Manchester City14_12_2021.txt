Matchday Manchester City vs Leeds. With Bamford and Philips out for Leeds we need to take advantage of that. I’m expecting a little bit of a rotated team tonight too freshen things up maybe Foden. We need to just win, even if it’s 1-0 we need to stay top. COME ON CITY, CTID💙

According to Fichajes, Manchester City have joined Real Madrid in the race for Leicester midfielder Youri Tielemans.

The Belgium international has starred for the Foxes since arriving in the Premier League and could soon be the subject of big-money bids.



At this point, if Manchester City get Jamshedpur FC in the CL RO16 next year, it wouldn’t be a surprise 😭😭

Aguero joined the Spanish club this summer after joining Manchester City. The forward only played five matches for Barcelona, ​​and he only played 90 minutes on the pitch once.

During a performance in England, the Argentine became the five-time champion of the country.



Aguero is Manchester City's top scorer with 275 goals. In addition, he is the most productive foreign footballer in the history of the English Premier League and the record holder for the number of hat-tricks (12).

I can also say the same with Manchester City. Would be fun to go against either of them…
