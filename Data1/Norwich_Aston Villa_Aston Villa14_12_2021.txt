Premier League, Round 17
Norwich City - Aston Villa.... Aston Villa ml to win..



🚨 Aston Villa's Marvelous Nakamba 🇿🇼 could miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. Villa will now consider signing another midfielder in the January transfer window. #AVFC

Norwich City vs Aston Villa is on ESPN 2 (South America). With commentary from Pablo Bari. Co-commentator is @javitabares.  For more details see https://t.co/R64iK0zGpe #NorwichCity #AstonVilla #ESPNSouthAmerica



“Steven Gerrard has admitted Aston Villa will take a player’s vaccine status into consideration when drawing up their list of January transfer targets.” https://t.co/OXTdiAhGrZ



Nakamba's is out of the AFCON and is a major doubt for the rest of Aston Villa's season. Such bad luck as he was starting to hit his stride under Gerrard.
