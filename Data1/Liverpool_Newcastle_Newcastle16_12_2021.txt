So that’s no Virgil, Fabinho and Curtis for Newcastle (Home), Tottenham (Away), Liverpool (Home in cup) and likely Leeds at Home too. And a chance of more players getting covid FFS

I hope Everton won't disappoint the Merseysiders.

Nothing is special about Chelsea or their darling Tuchel

If Moyes can do it, Benitez will easily do it better.

Can’t believe I have to watch Newcastle get battered by Liverpool. 

So annoying



Every time I refresh Twitter it seems another game is postponed due to Covid. I strongly recommend shutting down the season until Jan 31st. This will act as a ‘fire breaker’ in transmissions &amp; give Newcastle plenty of time to buy a new team without playing anymore games.

My #PremierLeague pick for tonight:

Liverpool-Newcastle➡️O 2.5➡️ 1.51 odd!
💡Liverp. scores 2.38 goals in average at home, while Newcastle concedes 2.13 away (average) and scores 1.06 (av.). I think over 70% probability of O 2.5!

Good luck! #bettingsports #sportsbettingpicks

just had an email from the club about Newcastle you've gotta fill in some form basically saying you ain't got symptoms &amp; have either a pass or a negative test.



Okay, let's beat Newcastle tonight. Then postpone the league for a few days. Will give some time for Bobby to recover. Also postpone the AFCON until the summer. Because why not? There's no Euros or World cup taking place. And hopefully COVID situation will have improved.



If United match v Newcastle goes ahead, that will mean they’ve had 16 days between matches. Of course some may have had COVID but many should be well rested. Could be a lot of matches to play after Christmas to catch up!

This isn’t a surprise and Newcastle will inevitably be off largely because you have fitness issues post quarantine and then chances are Newcastle players will be next up.

As a Newcastle United fan I can totally get behind calls for a postponement to the Premier League season. I’d even go as far as to a say it should be paused until the 1st of February. You know, just to be on the safe side and all that. Just thinking of the players safety. #NUFC

No idea how #NUFC can stop Liverpool tonight but their best course of action is to revert to a back five and try to frustrate them as best they can. 

It probably won't be enough but hopefully it can keep the score down and give them a glimmer of hope.

Drawing 2-2 at home to Southampton &amp; drawing 1-1 at home to Newcastle have honestly been so much more enjoyable to watch than beating some teams 1-0 last season.

I know it's a results business but performances matter. https://t.co/egmrDM4AMS

It’s starting to feel like Liverpool v Newcastle tonight at Anfield (I’m there) is a game that doesn’t need to be played. It’s like the Atletico Madrid game all over again. Are we just sleepwalking into making all the same mistakes another time?

Will there be a surprise that no one expects that Liverpool will become arrogant and take a complacency in the interest of Newcastle😂



I am just incredibly tired of the panic and the false info being spread about the Newcastle cluster. Like I wish everyone would just shut the fuck up. It’s actually more annoying than Covid itself. #upset



Most painful part of that Newcastle game last szn was they already had a goal disallowed unfairly like 20 seconds earlier😂😂😂
