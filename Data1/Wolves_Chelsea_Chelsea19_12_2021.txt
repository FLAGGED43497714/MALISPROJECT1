Chelsea have 7 players out with covid and there game isn’t postponed. Regardless of supposed bias, it’s a callous decision to let a team with a covid outbreak play against a team barely affected. @premierleague sort it out 🤷‍♂️

Chelsea fans are a different breed aren’t they lol, including Chillwell who’s out injured and James who’s in the squad. Which leaves them with a max 5 players out and they want to postpone it? https://t.co/agY0d1JIfT



This is why I am so happy for this chelsea down fall and long may it continue. Their fans compare everything even injury lists💀 https://t.co/CWMUEs9znA



There was a stage where Chelsea fans tried to convince themselves Tuchel was better with youth than Lampard.

Chelsea vs the world 🤷🏽‍♂️



Almost 8 players  tested positive for covid 19 for chelsea but premier league rejected the request for postponing today's match 😭😭



#Chelsea have had a request to postpone today's game against Wolves rejected by the #PremierLeague. Is this an agenda against Chelsea?



Chelsea requested the game be postponed on the basis there will have to be players on the bench who are not fit enough to play. PL rejected on basis they ruled Chelsea have 14 players available for the game. Chelsea had two further positives yesterday and one today #cfc



So for Chelsea the English Fa would follow the 14 players rule, for others they postpone games.



Reports suggest Chelsea had a request rejected to postpone today's game at Wolves. #wwfc https://t.co/CxQOTgDxj3

1 minute till Chelsea Twitter meltdown 😂



This is your Chelsea team today! 🤝 

@ParimatchGlobal #WolChe https://t.co/LJSX6MweWC



There's an agenda against Chelsea. With every decision against us it is clear.



Liverpool is dropping points today and it’s obvious, for Manchester city I can’t say that so Chelsea fc should close the gab with Liverpool this afternoon.



Agenda against Chelsea will never stop. https://t.co/FtwGqGo2Y7



A Chelsea fans group just Dm @OfficialFad123 your handle.



Need to enjoy this match, it’ll be Chelsea’s last of 2021



There is a campaign against Chelsea in the EPL. Known this since Mourinho days. It’s why the PL won’t properly congratulate us on winning the #UCL and also reject the clubs application to postpone matches cos of Covid infections.



Chelsea without a forward today basically. Premier League has to NOT stop the Prem. Integrity and fairness means that every team has to feel the unpredictable nature of having enough players to play but maybe not in all positions



Looks like the wolves Chelsea game goes ahead.
Despite Chelsea wanting to postpone.

#FPL #WolChe

https://t.co/AAUIWPmy11



Lmao Chelsea try include Chilwell as if he ain’t injured 😭 https://t.co/dk3T4SBUuW



Feels weird to have a match day with so many games called off, but City and Chelsea dropping points before a win for us at Spurs would cheer me right up! I’ll have some of that all day long! #CheEve #NEWMCI #TOTLIV #LFC #PremierLeague #Liverpool #YNWA https://t.co/2e8yFXalIX



I *think* Chelsea will have just four outfield players on the bench. #CFC



If I speak about the Premier League, I will be in big Trouble…
There is a campagn against Chelsea !
There is no other Explanation



I have tried to look through all the angles but i dont see how chelsea will beat Wolves. And its not banter.



Chelsea should still win btw so all these excuses are air



Is the Chelsea game still going ahead?



But Chelsea is bigger than Arsenal https://t.co/BWPjMRXitL



Don't understand how villa's game was postponed, Manutd's game was postponed when they had the squad depth to play the matches but not Chelsea. The lack of clarity and lack of consistency is abhorrent. https://t.co/oJenzKShi3

PL rejects Chelsea request to postpone Wolves game https://t.co/ySrC6kgXSJ



There’s two PL games today kicking off in the same time slot. Sky seem to have selected the much more boring and dull fixture to broadcast because of a narrative about the two richest clubs in the country.

Instead of the much more intriguing and compelling Wolves v Chelsea. https://t.co/SKpuUhr8us



IT'S MATCHDAY...!!!

It's Wolves at Molineux.

We got one more Covid case today in the squad. Honestly don't know how many players are going to miss the game.

But we really need to pick up those 3 crucial points today.

Let's go boys, COME ON CHELSEA...!!! 👊💙 https://t.co/r6mkiVKxul



Chelsea are ridiculous. The depth of the squad. Get a grip and get on with it. https://t.co/d7EX6u1id9

well how exciting is to be a chelsea fan in december right



Chelsea football club. Happy for the game against Everton at home to go ahead despite Everton ravaged by injury and illness. Today, they want the game against Wolves away called off. Let's pick and choose when we want to play based on whether we think we can win. Pathetic



2 minutes away from Chelsea twitter meltdown.



Villa had their game called off 2hours before kickoff, but FA vehemently rejects Chelsea’s plea to postpone.. there has always been a campaign against Cfc,no doubts.



Just heard that Chelsea tried to get the game postponed. Their squad is massive. Piss right off.



The PL are a disgrace didn’t hesitate to postpone wonderful man Uniteds games noooo can’t have that image on the England favourites but fuck CHELSEA right. What a joke



Chelsea fans crying about not having players, try being an Everton fan when most of our players are out and are having to use the under 23’s https://t.co/EefOnV3Fw3



Chelsea play anything other 0-0 lose, win i dont care, win tho



Be a horrid cold day at Wolves today for Chelsea plus thyre hit with covid... fancy wolves to take somethin



Chelsea getting bummed off the F.A 🤣 Tried cancelling today's game an  got rejected good enough for them 🖕



no way I'm seeing Chelsea fans cry about their injuries 💀 try having 8 senior players available



One rule for another. Disgusting agenda against Chelsea. I remember a certain José Mourinho saying something like that. #Chelsea



there is literally an agenda against chelsea wtf practically more than half the squad has covid yet everyone else gets their games postponed except us bye



I need Chelsea to keep dropping points



the aston villa chelsea game is going to get cancelled innit



The man who has won it all!

Chelsea India wishes a very Happy Birthday to club legend &amp; former skipper @GaryJCahill. Have a great one Gary 💙🎉

#CFC #ChelseaIndia https://t.co/qSzzjkEG31



beating chelsea 6-0 was so sexy of us



Chelsea fans 🤝🏾 1000000 excuses before the game



No striker for Chelsea, anyway they aren't even prolific



Statement from the Premier League.

We, today have declined Chelsea Football Club ask to postpone their game against Wolverhampton Wanderers. 

We believe the reason given that they are a bit pants at the moment and need a break is not a valid one.



2mins to Chelsea twitter meltdown



I see @premierleague want Man City or Liverpool to win the league this season.

#EPL #WolChe #Chelsea #PremierLeague #postpone https://t.co/QZfpTBqYZz



Looking forward to chelsea not having a sub bench today ffs 🙄 😑



Chelsea have their request to postpone the game rejected.
In that case, every club should abide by the same ruling. No more postponements, if you cant field a full team you either play with youth or forfeit the match.

Cant have one rule for one and one for another.

#WolChe



Chelsea match not getting postponed and we have 9 players out 😭 tell me again how the premier league is fair



I think we can legally hold pl responsible if anything happens to Chelsea players today. They created and pushed this mess https://t.co/hdZ0gp7UZg

Chelsea being the most successful English side in last 2 decades despite every organization having an agenda against us means we are simply gargantuan 🙃



Situation for Chelsea is ridiculous. Can’t pick a team until two hours before the game. If six games are off, they all should be. Should’ve made an early call (for fans too). This time next year I’m sure isolation will be a thing of the past as we’ll all just have to live with it



Chelsea Fc please win today, I’m begging you.🙆🏼

It is baffling that Harvey Vale doesn't get anywhere near the Chelsea XI despite all their injuries. Tuchel is making a big mistake here imo.



At least I have an excuse for this season now. Doesn’t count in MY FACTUAL BOOK OF TRUTHS. Forcing a handicapped Chelsea to play whilst everyone else gets days off. This is why we’re European champions !!!/!£/72£:

This is madness.

Obviously I'm biased but this genuinely affects the league table/title etc.



Those Chelsea fans sure get about, don't they? Just scum behaviour. #youletyourclubdie https://t.co/sHtWLAymLP



Can someone list for me the confirmed COVID cases among the Chelsea squad?



It's clear now that FA hate Chelsea. No other evidence needed https://t.co/cTLgyqJAEx



Be interesting to see the team Chelsea put out today to see true extent



But the premier league still adamant the game is going ahead aside from anything else there is clearly an outbreak within the Chelsea squad this is deeply irresponsible https://t.co/YfJFmvTF6c



absolute joke that Chelsea have to play with Covid ripping through their squad



Premier League 'reject Chelsea's request to postpone Wolves clash' https://t.co/IyPkjUuu1R via @MailSport



Chelsea moaning when in reality they have probably upwards of 40 players out on loan that they have signed and never played.



we couldn't play v derby but Chelsea forced to play with 14 players this is boring https://t.co/nr3jinStdl



Chelsea's request to have today's game against Wolves postponed has been rejected by the Premier League: 

"We are deeply disappointed that our application was rejected as we felt we had a strong case for postponement of the match on the grounds of players’ health and safety."



I can guarantee you that it’s a Chelsea problem. Get Vlahovic like this, and he’ll turn Bebe in 3 match days. https://t.co/IONRw6tGiL



Campaign. Against. Chelsea. https://t.co/bZmtT8uV7Y



Well, if the rule says unless the squad has 14 or less players left to warrant a cancelation and Chelsea still has 17 players available then the match can go ahead IMO. #WOLCHE



They’re deffo tryna sabotage Chelsea’s ting. 14 PLAYERS!?!? 3 subs????



Chelsea almost have a 25 man squad out on loan https://t.co/hyNMHvn2p7



Mbona other matches are being postponed ya Chelsea wanatuambia never



Here we go the premier league cancel everyone's games, Chelsea ask for the same after an outbreak we are told no!
Got to love the support hopefully everything player has it and passes it on to everyone 
F**K THE FA 
Corrupt and bent



Different rules for different teams. Fill blown campaign against Chelsea. https://t.co/cIPEAui7XC



Chelsea with 7 covid cases and injuries request their match against wolves be postponed. FA a*sholes said NO. There is a campaign against Chelsea. Its Chelsea vs the world.

There is an agenda against Chelsea.



Chelsea are only going to have 3 subs???



This one di333 Wolves get Chelsea gbee loo. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dem go eat dem rough!!!



Actually a joke that the prem have rejected Chelsea from not playing. They actually hate us and it showssss. We have 7 players who have covid yet there still making us play fucking joke that is.



“This follows two players being confirmed as positive cases yesterday, with another testing positive for COVID-19 overnight.”

“..they could be forced to field a team who are lacking match fitness.”

This isn’t fair competition, it’s the COVID lottery.

https://t.co/3CJPJdiR4i



So if Chelsea have 14 available players for today's match against Wolves and Saul and Kepa are on the bench that means only one other player will not be in the starting lineup.



Chelsea have a huge squad (which they also use to send out on loan to make £££), no way should they be allowed to postpone games https://t.co/gmq5WNbPdI



Sack Tuchel and bring in Ole and Chelsea back up and running



I’m interested to know the PL’s justification for not letting Chelsea postpone their game. Is there a certain number of covid cases you must have?



Be a fucking miracle if Chelsea dont drop points



There is a campaign against Chelsea!! https://t.co/xU77tW1U6j



How the FA is allowing Chelsea’s game to go ahead even after reporting Covid cases in their camp is one I don’t understand

Chelsea should’ve simply renamed themselves Man Utd, then they wouldn’t be playing today



Premier League just said to Chelsea "keep quiet and suffer"



As a life long Chelsea fan I have to admit that I have never seen a better player then Saul Niguez. Give him another chance in the midfield and he will show the world class player he really is. https://t.co/m0tsSDWYqB



Chelsea wins and trophies are always infinitely sweeter because of all the adversity we pass through on the journey…



Chelsea have confirmed a request to postpone their match at Wolves has been rejected.

The Blues were already without Lukaku, Werner and Hudson-Odoi due to positive Covid-19 tests and it's understood they've lost more players since.

Everyone defending the PL says it all. Your clubs got games called off, so you're alright and can avoid an injury crisis in the midst of COVID breakouts. Chelsea have to deal with COVID, injuries and fielding not fully fit players which can lead to more injuries.

Wolves 1 - 3 Chelsea😎
Spurs 1 - 2 Liverpool 😉 https://t.co/hlotxRqtNg



All other clubs get the postponement request granted by the PL but when Chelsea requests it for the same reasons due to COVID we get denied..

How is that fair @premierleague @FA



#Chelsea playing against PL agenda today.



The Chelsea players should not play the Wolves game period



Kante and Chalobah both start for Chelsea. 

Source - Cfcnewspage on Instagram. 

#FPL



Chelsea fans are coward playing against wolves 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You go play whether you like it or not



Marcos Alonso and Reece James have been confirmed to be part of the squad for today's game. J5, kai and RLC seem as doubts for the match.
#WOLCHE chelsea



Chelsea crying and moaning play the game if not get a 3-0 loss



So Chelsea requested for game to be postponed but Premier League rejected their request.

Game on!

The Telegraph is reporting that Chelsea's request to have the game against Wolves postponed has been rejected by the Premier League. Chelsea apparently has the minimum 7 cases required to suspend a match. Chelsea can't use under 23 because of bubble rules. Agenda against Chelsea

#CFC did request for today's match to be called off, as per @ben_rumsby but that request was denied. Six other matches called off this weekend, yet the show must go on for Chelsea. https://t.co/pEDPEBqoiE



🚨 | Chelsea confirm they requested to postpone their match against Wolves which was rejected. 

🗣 "We are deeply disappointed that our application was rejected as we felt we had a strong case for the postponement of today‘s match on the grounds of players’ health and safety." https://t.co/ZjsVOfBT7X



8 covid cases confirmed, PL: eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee courseeeee lets just damage public health and ruin Chelsea's chance at the title
POSTPONE THE GAME!



Chelsea is playing today? Wait Sancho will trend soon 😆🔥🔥🔥



Don't believe in games being called off for covid but how can the Premier league reject chelsea's request for postponement, with 5 positive cases, having already cancelled multiple games?? The double standard is insane!



Chelsea have ‘request’ for Wolves game rejected by Premier League https://t.co/kBr1dcBVgX



The Agenda against Chelsea is so obvious now, cause how can we go ahead with our match when about 7 starters for the club has tested positive but other get their match postponed after just 3 cases 🤷🏽‍♂️

THE HATE IS SO CLEAR!

So United game postponed after 3 COVID cases.....But Chelsea must play after 5 cases- of which 3 are all their  forwards . Sounds very fair huh?



Wait why do Chelsea want the game postponed? Because they have a bunch of injuries and like three covid cases?



There's a campaign against Chelsea indeed.



Chelsea fans let stop this conspiracy theory that the Fa is against our team bla bla even our own players are letting us down that’s the main problem not the Fa.



How can 8+ cases not be valid enough to postpone the Chelsea game. Evidently player welfare only applies to some teams



Will chelsea wolves be postponed?



The EPL hating Chelsea is nothing new. That there's people that don't believe it is what surprises me. How or why today's fixture is going to happen is beyond me.



Credit to Leeds Utd fans who did not moan about playing yesterday despite so many players being out

In contrast have a look at how many Chelsea fans are crying because their game is going ahead today

Stop crying, most your players are out through injury

#LEEARS #WOLCHE



IT'S MATCHDAY...!!!

It's Wolves at Molineux.

We got one more Covid case today in the squad. Honestly don't know how many players are going to miss the game.

But we really need to pick up those 3 crucial points today.

I’ve calmed down a little today and put my positive head back on. Chelsea, City, Arsenal &amp; L’pool back to back who currently sit top 4. We are miles behind them in terms of squad depth and player value. In all honesty I didn’t expect a single point in any of those games. #LUFC



I’m even sure I remember Jack and Chelsea having one fling and he’s marrying her mum 🤢🤢🤢 https://t.co/WKkcNdgvHv



How did Chelsea get their request to postpone the game rejected but other teams had it accepted ?



Predicted Chelsea XI 🖲

v Wolves (my opinion)

• Rumour is we’ve requested the game to be postponed (Rejected)

• Rumour of 3 fresh covid cases (unsure who) 

• Genuinely think we will see Chalobah in the middle.

• Confident of the front 3. The rest was tricky.

#CFC | #FPL https://t.co/9qxFq7FVSR



PL: ok you can have games called off if you have less than 14 of your 25 man squad available
Chelsea: well ok we have 19 but that includes players we don’t play!
PL: no

Chelsea wanting to postpone today is convenient, now they’re not playing against a team of kids expecting to win 5-0



Chelsea fans are so upset the game isn’t postponed today when they have a weaker squad, but I didn’t see the same ones moaning when Everton had a very depleted squad &amp; couldn’t even fill their bench on Thursday against Chelsea? Strange that..

Would love to know the threshold for postponing games due to Covid. Chelsea have 7 positive cases (sounds like an outbreak to me) and yet the match against Wolves goes ahead. The families of the Wolves players must be well chuffed. Why take the risk of infecting others?



I wonder what Chelsea’s mindset will be for the game? 

Not mentally ready to play football or being furious enough to take it out on the pitch?

Crazy the amount of defending that’s going on for the PL whilst 6 other matches this weekend get called off. Just exactly the same as when Chelsea get a dodgy ref decision. Going the opposite to be edgy.



Embarrassing from Chelsea asking for the match to be postponed with the size of their squad, Wolves only have a squad of 16 but ya know what we just crack on with it.
Chelsea are pathetic.

Laughable that Chelsea, a club that has stockpiled players for almost two decades tried to get a game postponed because they claim to not have enough players. That club is everything that is wrong with modern football.



How's Chelsea players just getting affected by covid-19 one after the other all of a sudden? 🙄😥



Chelsea get ready to win today's match



Thoughts on the Premier League’s decision to reject #Chelsea’s postponement request, Blues?



The premier league has handled this terrible how is the Chelsea game still on

Chelsea's request to postpone the match with Wolves has been rejected by EPL.

You should understand why we say you are the smallest club in England. 

You are small and hence they don't take your words serious.. You can't do this to Man United or Liverpool. Naa 😂😂

The @premierleague showing their bias against Chelsea. If there is no bias against Chelsea, they should prove it by calling off the match against Wolves. 

Call off the game now.



I’m pleased Chelsea game goes ahead today I think it’s a massive joke that PL sides with a squad of 25 players and all of them have an U23 side seem to be unable to pick 14 players on their books to play a game of football

How is the chelsea game allowed to go ahead when we have 7 first team players out with covid yet teams with less cases have had their game called off



has earned the respect of their peers after the Chelsea manager was named the 2023 World Coach of the Year. #FM22Mobile



'There is a campaign against Chelsea' is real!



If Liverpool get 7 Covid cases, the game gets called off. Fact. Of course it’s Chelsea so we have to get on with it. But it’s all fair and above-board. Sure. Sure it is. Nothing whatsoever to do with envelopes of cash from Chinese betting syndicates. Nope. Nothing to see here.



Without knowing full details, it does seem odd that Chelsea's request was turned down and it's a huge problem that we don't know on what grounds and why their case is judged different to some others. It certainly leaves PL open to accusations of bias etc....

Having seen Wolves and Chelsea play recently I would be laying Chelsea all day at 1.8 today



A Chelsea win today will be miraculous
- Out of form
- 7 key players testing positive for COVID
- No strikers available
- Appeal to postpone game gets turned down.

Holly Molly!!!😞

Is the Chelsea match being played or not???unacceptable if they cancel it at this point people having travelled up,but nothing would suprise me from the FA



Jose was right all those years ago. There is a campaign against Chelsea. Always has been always will. @premierleague we need answers &amp; now. You bunch of money hungry thieving assholes.

If there's one thing I've learnt since I started supporting Chelsea is, whenever they hate us so much and there's so much agenda or campaign against us, we ALWAYS come out on TOP.

Why are Chelsea fans crying out that their game against Wolves should be postponed? 7 +ve covid-19 cases aren't enough to make a Premier League match get postponed, thank you @premierleague  👏

Chelsea have 7 present COVID cases . postpone the god fucking dammit game @premierleague



I partially understand why the Chelsea game isn’t cancelled. 

We have 7 players out. So it means we have 18 registered players available. 

They can’t just start cancelling games due to schedule issues. 

Clarity would be great but let’s not moan.



7 covid cases in the first time squad and Chelsea have their request for the game postponed cancelled by the @premierleague 😂 kinda making a mockery of the integrity of the league and it’s fairness at the moment isn’t it 🤔

Damn. I overslept this morning. I don't have Covid and I was meant to be playing CM for Chelsea today. I'm not going to make it in time now.



Loooool Chelsea can still field an XI good enough to win this match.



Always makes me inordinately angry when Chelsea are described as 'The Blues'.



Chelsea has 7 positive cases, how many positive cases does Manchester United have?



This covid with footy teams is bollocks. What's the rule how many cases need to be reported for the game to be called off. How come last season teams were still playing. Leeds,Oxford,Chelsea just to name a few have cases but still put teams out. 🤷🏻‍♂️

This all comes despite SIX other games being postponed.

In the grand scheme of things, my expectations for this Chelsea side were so high and they've disappointed me massively, so my plan is to pretend I don't care about them in the slightest and see if it triggers a reaction in them. Hopefully it works. Let's all lose hope.



Messi Chelsea and Liverpool una dey ment😭😭😭



In addition - 20+ CB pairings, various different forwards, 3 different goalies all throughout the season and then still finish 3rd. Chelsea fans find a reason to moan about everything. https://t.co/31muzXoK94



I want to know what the requirements are for a game to be cancelled. 6 eligible players down with Covid as of yesterday (also Ben Chilwell). At least one more must have tested positive for Chelsea to request a postponement today, otherwise they would have done it yesterday.



Chelsea want  to cancel todays game because they have 4(four) players with Covid. Look 👀 at Leeds. Top clubs always after preferential treatment



They should cancel the Chelsea match c'mon



Chelsea fans tryna do humble before the game so they don't get bantered later.. Super team no? No excuses

The Premier League have rejected a request from #Chelsea to postpone Today's meeting with Wolverhampton Wanderers 🐺.

🤤



Breaking news. #Wolverhampton Wanderers v Chelsea



#PremierLeague there is no consistency this is a joke #cfc #chelsea



Someone is not happy with Chelsea being in title race.😣 https://t.co/qVL9HUCBiF



Football is all about the money that’s why Chelsea, Man City and Liverpool games will all go ahead as long as 11 players are available for each team today as they’re the top 3 teams some people put money before the health of others it’s pure greed on the premier leagues behalf https://t.co/8XPOVilwFA



How the fuck are chelsea gonna play with 7 positive players out? What is up with that? Surely that’s not ok?



Team news and predicted line-ups ahead of Wolves vs Chelsea https://t.co/42yeg1l1mn



Some chelsea fans are really funny how can u expect premiere league to postpone our match is not possible the coach or the club should have told them to vaccinate



Chelsea are 100% losing today😭



LATEST: Levy preparing huge Spurs offer for "absolute leader", he'd be "outstanding" for Conte - opinion #THFC https://t.co/38dtEjoGzq



Female reporter Milena on @SkyNews just now talking about the virus. Too posh. Would have been better placed in Made in Chelsea. Very irritating.



IF #Chelsea asked Prem to postpone today’s match and IF were refused then serious serious questions must be asked.  Be interesting to see the line up. This is the type of game CFC will need siege mentality.



If Martineli was Lille Dortmund player Arsenal Man City Chelsea Liverpool wanted him it be 80M



Why isn't Chelsea's request granted? Bathong this is an agenda clearly



I want even be surprised United have no Covid case. The FA just postponing their matches so their new manager can have time to implement his fugazy ideas into Fred and Mctominay. I know this cus United are in bed with the Fa and they hate Chelsea 😔😔



in the worst case scenario chelsea could be closer to 4th place than either of the title contenders, crazy



Its official: The premier league never loved Chelsea #Chelsea https://t.co/3zzedKtUJU



Well fuck chelsea ig, good luck to the players,

They can play the shitest game they've ever played, and they still won't be slandered https://t.co/OqdrZQC73r



There’s a campaign against Chelsea



“ When Covid Ends” is starting to sound a lot like “ When will there not be an agenda against Chelsea”



Aston Villa game against Man United was postponed because of Covid, but Chelsea will play Wolves because of Covid...it’s a Chelsea thing, we understand @premierleague



Chelsea fans moaning when they have ridiculous squad depth while 7 cases isn't ideal can easily get a squad to play look at clubs like Brighton who have been forced to play with small squads



How can this fucking Chelsea game go ahead?? So many out with Covid but yet the games still needs to get played yet other games get postponed what a joke this is 🤬🤬



This agenda against Chelsea in the premier league is actually appalling. From the refs (Anthony Taylor) to the fa itself. Last season there were some very questionable decision that went against us and favorable decision that went for our rivals to ensure they got top 4.



Chelsea twitter go bloody today



You can bet if you follow an SA Liverpool fan who isn’t Yasmin, they are all have their TL about Chelsea 

Idk what we’ve done to those lot but the obsession is mad 😭



Wolves fit win Chelsea today sha....



Chelsea will suffer today



How do you reject Chelsea's claim to cancel and you are bringing a safe post on. 7 players out cos of covid. Make it make sense! https://t.co/vllabtJ9j3



Looks like injury/covid Chelsea playing today



Here's an expert advice ...don't try to argue with a chelsea fan today or for the coming few days....there's a good chance you won't see tomorrow. Heads hot👍🏼. #UTC

The Premier League is a corrupt institution and they have an agenda against Chelsea football club

What are the reasons for the Premier League allowing other games to be postponed but not granting Chelsea the same leeway? I genuinely want to know? Why/how is 7 positive cases not enough grounds to postpone the game?



We know the agenda against Chelsea

You know it is hypocrisy for the management of the Premier League to postpone other peoples games but insist on Chelsea, a side depleted by Omicron to continue playing. If this is not first class hypocrisy and gang up against Chelsea, I wonder what it is.



Chelsea should play the players with COVID.



These are the games chelsea could go and in win easily.



Chelsea, hazard and Ibra ball in one day ?🤩🤩



They should postpone Chelsea's match abeg.



My God, Chelsea fans have a serious victim complex for such a "big" club. Whinging and whining all over my timeline 🙄



Matchday Blog | Wolves vs Chelsea #wolves #wwfc 
https://t.co/oowzQVC1w9



Chelsea have been rejected to postpone the Wolfe’s game. After 6 players tested positive for covid. Man United and Brent Ford game was postponed. All these other games. But when Chelsea ask they say no? Why is going on in the world right now. Your players are scared for their. https://t.co/y35G0c31Qs



United getting games postponed with majority of their covid cases being staffs but Chelsea game has to go ahead with 7 starters having covid and unift players.



This thing English FA are doing to Chelsea does not make any sense, how many more players have to test positive before they decide to cancel our games ? United haven’t played 2 games in a row but we can’t even skip one?



This is utterly disgraceful. Chelsea have had a big covid outbreak, we’ve barely got players available, and we’re forced to play whilst other clubs have had their games postponed way further in advance, and with less cases. Irresponsible, absurd, and a clear campaign against us. https://t.co/B7Wzt7cko2



What, these are the players out, and Chelsea want the game postponed?? LOOOOL. They've got more than enough to cope here. https://t.co/g7huDT3EJP



They want Chelsea to fail bad



No way Chelsea fans are crying because they actually have to play a football match. Tbf I would cry if I had watch Tuchel ball every week too don’t blame em



BREAKING: Chelsea vs Wolves postponed 1 minute before kick off. https://t.co/z23YewQgOz



Why are Chelsea fans nervous and worried about today??? I mean going by fans logic losing Alonso and Jorginho isn't a big deal, 1 player is slow and shit and the other does 1577373 back passes with no end product 

Advantage Chelsea 🥴🥴🤔🤔

Whoever wears that Chelsea shirt has my full support.

Since this lot has a campaign against Chelsea, we should have a campaign against them as well. Put Lukaku, Werner, CHO up front. Alonso, James and Jorgi in midfield and hug all players and officials before the kick off. https://t.co/kBb9mwlqov

Jose Mourinho was absolutely right. It was and it's always going to be CAMPAIGN AGAINST CHELSEA. https://t.co/mbDE87I2m5



Very mature of the dumfcuk @premierleague to let a team with 7 covid positive cases travel to play against a team with no cases. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

Smort 1diots. Not only risking the Chelsea team but now the Wolves team as well. #WOLCHE



Chelsea fans please cry more 😂😂😂



it's Chelsea, EPL would ask us to play even if we had 15 players out with covid #WOLCHE



🚨🚨 | Chelsea have had a request to postpone today’s Wolves game rejected by Premier League.

[Telegraph Sport]



Big moves can be made in the Premier League today, pending lineups.

Need to see if Son x Salah are gonna play, and bet that match accordingly.

Also want to fade Chelsea, but need to see lineups for both teams.

Man City o3.25 looks very good, regardless of lineups.

#WolChe



Sick of #chelsea fans complaining their match isn’t postponed just because they don’t have their top players avail - some through injury. What happened to your squad depth? You were happy to play a severely depleted Leeds squad last week…#WOLCHE



Happy the #Chelsea game is going ahead (for now) but fear Alonso will miss out as potentially one of the newly-infected players with COVID ❌😬



Different rules for Different Clubs. But we are chelsea, depleted squad but not out by any means. Want to see the fighting spirit from the playing 11 today (if we can field one)



SEVEN positive cases, and with so many other fixtures having already been postponed, Chelsea’s request for a postponement of their own is denied?  So now we’re forced to field INJURED players AND risk further spreading the virus?  The FA’s outdone themselves yet again.  #Agenda https://t.co/qrZOtRACx6

Why are Chelsea calling for their game to be postponed? How many covid cases do they have? It's either the premier league suspends the season else teams with injuries will apply for their games to be postponed using covid as the excuse



This is actually mental wtf

Chelsea have request to postpone today's Wolves game rejected by Premier League | @ben_rumsby reports https://t.co/3o7CsCwXde



How many United players tested positive? They locked off their next two games with ease but yep no rest for Chelsea brilliant agenda prem



Hi, @premierleague. 

COVID aside, why were 7 of the 10 fixtures this weekend called off but Chelsea’s rejected? 

If your view is that we meet the 14 player threshold then I think you should provide an explanation as to why the other games were postponed?

Many thanks.



🚨 Breaking: #Chelsea have had a request to postpone today's Wolves game rejected by Premier League.

The request was turned down on Sunday morning and could force Chelsea to have unfit players on the bench later this afternoon.

If you have 14 players then you should play simple as that. Can’t use more than 14 players anyways….Chelsea have spent half of Russia’s GDP to start complaining about not having enough depth😂.



Don’t postpone Chelsea demma matches. Abi dem say dem get mad squad depth, make dem play on. La Cobham too dey. Top top academy https://t.co/FYLWNvY78I



The PL will always have an agenda against Chelsea.



7 covid cases but the PL won't postpone the game becos it's CHELSEA



Chelsea ..how many players have u got..you played us with our team suffering ffs



THEY HATE CHELSEA 😂 THATS WHY WE KEEP WINNING



Its  been clear for years that the PL doesn't rate Chelsea but today??? We literally have 7 players out due to Covid and the league rejected our request to have the game suspended. It's truly different rules for different clubs



No, he’s damaged goods. And if we accept players who left us with open arms, it creates the perception that Chelsea are a feeder club who can be a safety net for players once they’ve gone to the club they want to play at, but couldn’t cut it. https://t.co/GnSq6jHCNa



The blame game's clearly on at Chelsea and inevitably at Liverpool, where Covid is somehow regarded as a @ManCity conspiracy, created to deprive Kloppites of the Premiership...👕👀



Day 5 covid isolation and I’ll feel a lot better for a Chelsea win, City/Liverpool dropping points and over indulging in the darts!



This is a legitimate, sustained, and corrupt agenda against Chelsea from the premier league and there has been ever since Roman took over



Wolves vrs Chelsea is not cancelled. Money can't buy everything I guess!!



Sounds like we've lost before it's even started.

Obviously the odds will be stacked against us, but we're fucking Chelsea.

Stop the negativity and get behind the lads who will be in that starting 11

Also, we're having to use some players who aren't completely fit .. We're likely to get more injuries due to this game being allowed to go ahead. The @premierleague are breaking any form of duty of care towards players health and wellbeing, but it's alright 'cos it's Chelsea.

Chelsea have shot themselves in the foot recently against Burnley, United, West Ham and Everton. We should have far more points than we do which would have eased the current situation of the squad. But we have no chance getting points against Wolves, our squad is decimated



Choices of football today. Do I want to watch:
Liverpool beat Tottenham 3-0,
Chelsea beat Wolves 4-0 or
Man City beat Newcastle 8-0?
Can we just award the points and move on?

No idea how the Chelsea game is still on with the amount of Covid cases they’ve announced.



One of the stranger elements of this latest Covid surge in the PL is that Chelsea’s big squad is arguably a disadvantage #CFC https://t.co/CNVxzwi0UE



Chelsea got one of the biggest squad and best academy in Europe, imagine having the effrontery to ask for  your game to be postponed because of just 7 COVID cases, the starting eleven this afternoon will be comfortably better and more expensive than Wolves.



THERES AN AGENDA AGAINST CHELSEA GOODBYE



Of course the @premierleague make Chelsea play the game today, 7 positive cases... Ah fuck it, it's Chelsea!! 

Bunch of wankers



Lots of clubs have had their games postponed even though they have few covid cases. 

But the premier league can't do same for Chelsea? even though we have more covid cases than some of these clubs. so unfair. smh. https://t.co/0iHjdKhMof

#FPL



And people think there isn't an agenda against Chelsea in this league?! So laughable it's a joke! All these other games called off this weekend but we have so many positive cases and we have to play. Simply gobsmacked, shambles of an organisation. #CFC @premierleague https://t.co/jrQbKUUUKq

The morale in the Chelsea camp right now must be rock bottom. Friends and teammates out with covid, rejected request by the Premier League while rivals (Spurs, United) are allowed cancel games whenever they like.

Remember that campaign against Chelsea?



And they'll tell with the straight face that Premier League doesn't hate Chelsea to its very core.

7 chelsea players have tested positive for Covid, all of them are first team players, but they’re still making us play, any other team would have their game called off, absolute disgrace

As much as I want to see Chelsea play today, this just doesn't make sense. At all https://t.co/3id7YQlN6a



The fact that the actual Chelsea team don’t want to be in Wolverhampton today fully vindicates my decision to not go in my opinion.



Chelsea with 7 covid cases and injuries request their match against wolves be postponed. FA said no. 🤒🤒Its Chelsea vs the world.



I mean, don't want to run the whole "agenda against Chelsea" thing but... agenda against Chelsea? https://t.co/UoN47jyQx3

Other clubs getting matches postponed after having 3 positives but Chelsea gets rejected after 5/6. Yeah sounds about fair from FA https://t.co/UodTmub5uK



If Chelsea do have 7 COVID cases amongst their first team and the PL decided against postponing their game, that’s a joke.



Chelsea fans, Do you want to win or lose today? If you want your team to win today just see me in chambers. Or else you’ll drop points again. 🤔 #WOLCHE

I’m really not rating clubs putting in constant requests for games to get postponed. The PL are handling this badly and it’s not a coincidence Chelsea are pushing for a postponement when they have no fit midfielders



chelsea fans playing victims like they are the only team with players out



The agenda against Chelsea is unreal - if Spurs and Leicester can cancel their match for less COVID cases then why can’t we?



Chelsea fans crying like they still don’t have a huge quality squad



Have to respect the consistency when it comes to making decisions against Chelsea https://t.co/vXBk8Ba2va



Bobby-Lee from Kansas and Mahmood from Indonesia absolutely fuming that Chelsea gotta play.

Strong Opinion Hibs advent calendar: 

Day 19:

James Keatings, Keatings made 70 appearances scoring 20 goals he was also a Scottish Cup winner

I am told Chelsea-Wolves is still on as it stands. 

My reading of the situation is that the status is quite fragile due to new Covid cases in the Blues squad. Tuchel likely to confirm player names ahead of kick-off, should the match go ahead. #CFC

Hearing James, Alonso &amp; Jorginho are out of the Chelsea's match due to Covid 

Kante 🤝 Kovacic

No way this Chelsea game should come on. What’s the criteria for postponing games? Feels like punishment at this point.
