Even all 3 spidermen can’t save Tottenham with a midfield of Dele, Winks and Tanguy.



If Tottenham's midfield three against Liverpool is Harry Winks, Tanguy Ndombele and Dele Alli you can expect Spurs to be spanked.



Chelsea have failed with a request to have their Premier League clash with Wolves postponed

Manchester City and Liverpool will probably win although a Spurs win will threaten our hold on top 4 even more. We're fighting 3rd and 4th place with Arsenal Tottenham Man Utd and West Ham. Could end up 7th if this slide continues. Hope we don't get battered today #CHELSEAFC



At last, Tottenham plays today.

Newcastle Man City O3.5 +110

Should be an interesting morning. Chelsea haven’t been good lately, but the price feels too good to not take. ManCity should blow out Newcastle. Also considering a win to zero bet.

#TOTLIV #LFC Hey guys, how much do you expect our match with Tottenham, who has a correct prediction who will win an iPhone 4 without a charger https://t.co/iUPJ307KXg



With London declaring a major incident surely the Premier League has to do the right thing and stop all the games, as far as I remember Tottenham is in London.



Tottenham Away ! Always a Good Game. #LFCYNWA ❤️ https://t.co/8M0uc6iDB8



#TOTLIV
I'm backing #Liverpool to take the points, especially given #Tottenham have won just one of their last 17 Premier League games against the Reds.

Tottenham 2-1 Liverpool heard it here first.



We could end up smashing Tottenham 5-0 or end up losing 3-0 and neither result would surprise me. We ain’t reached Cities inevitably just yet, 3 injuries and were mid-table but on our day we’re easily the BEST side in all of world football. Oh the wonders of supporting Liverpool!
