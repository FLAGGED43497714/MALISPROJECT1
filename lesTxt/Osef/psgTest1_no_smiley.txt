Let's be honest, Manchester United is drawing with PSG in the last 16    DNA  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gone and Manchester United turning into a serious football club. Things are getting better I guess.       Manchester United fans react to Ralf Rangnick's Paul Pogba comments     Arsenal giving Aubameyang captain is almost as funny if not more than Manchester United choosing Harry Maguire. Two dreadful decisions for leadership.      "Man United fans need to relax a little bit. He's very lucky to be the Man United manager, nobody else wanted him."

No special treatments for Paul or Mino under management of Ralf!    I think some people needed reminding that it's not Pogba FC, not Martial FC, not Rashford FC, not Bruno FC, not van de Beek FC, not whatever player FC. It's MANCHESTER UNITED FC and the club comes before anyone. Support the players but not over the club.     Manchester United got a 21 yr old talent for just £72million while we spend £100 mill on a fully grown man. Manchester United are better on the transfer market then us    I don’t tend to pay much attention to punditry any more.  Most pundits don’t look at the wider picture and what’s going on at Manchester United.  Rangnick’s main job is after his 6 months as interim manager, that’s where he is a specialist for that particular role.    Wow..

Pogba:     Norwich City v Manchester United - the two new boys go head to head at Carrow road at 17.30, with Ralph Rangnick so far favouring an unusual 4 -2- 2- 2 formation. He needs the 3 points as much as Dean Smith. Should be one hell of a game.     Ralf Rangnick has told Manchester United scouts take a closer look at Amadou Haidara, and has also identified Jude Bellingham and Kalvin Phillips as potential midfield targets.     Confirmed from above. Don't add anything just place as it is   Arsenal | Southampton - *DRAW ,HT/FT : X/X* Chelsea | Leeds - *Chelsea WIN.* Liverpool | Aston Villa - *Liverpool WIN.* Norwich | Manchester United - *Manchester United WIN.*    Pogba plays for Manchester United and Grealish plays for Abu Dhabi Fc nobody cares about them.
