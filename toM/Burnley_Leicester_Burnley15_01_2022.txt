Teams that played European football are on like 30 games.

Chelsea are out of the title race not because they lost home and away vs City, but because we dropped points against Burnley, United, Brighton, Everton, Wolves (2); Westham - 3. That’s a massive 13 points. In every of these games bar the United and Wolves game, we were in front.

Burnley have played 5 games less than Man City. Us, Spurs  amd a few other 4 less.

We would all still be at least 11 points behind Man City, even if we won all our games.

The blow isn't the 2 losses against Man City, they are a great side. Well drilled, well rested with some great squad depth.

The blow to our title hopes lies in the 7 draws against Man United, Burnley, Brighton, and that loss at West Ham - toothlessness!

Very proud of Arsenal for fighting to get this game postponed.

Enough of people feel that  the club can be bullied to do anything.

Liverpool had our EFL cup postponed for no just cause, nobody made noise.

Burnley's postponed today for not enough players, Wolves did same thing https://t.co/EtXdnHyo3L

A draw will be a terrible result today. Partly because we've already drawn too many, partly because Burnley will be back to having 3 games on in hand on us, partly because Watford play both Burnley &amp; Norwich before we go to Leeds. The "winnable" home games are running out fast 😬

I understand people saying we're better off taking relegation rivals best players to weaken them and strengthen us.

However, Norwich &amp; Burnley are already weak enough to go down.

We should be weakening the likes of Watford, Leeds &amp; Brentford to drag them into the mix.

What’s actually to stop Burnley next weekend from loaning players out / pretending that players are injured so they can postpone until after Cornet is back and they’ve replaced Wood. Like if we’re claiming Saka/Tierney are injured, how can we prove that when they’ll play Thursday

I think Chris Wood will be excellent at Newcastle, genuinely think it’s a superb signing. 

Needed someone who could come in an hit the ground running, had to purchase from within the league. 

And also makes Burnley worse of course.

Why is a request for postponement of the Arsenal vs Spurs game generating more interest and scrutiny than the Burnley-Leicester game which has actually been postponed?! The rules don’t say how many Covid19 you have to have to apply. It also looks at other factors. Arsenal agenda

Three scenarios for the Arsenal game:

1) we have 13+ fit outfield 1st team players &amp; play- fine

2) &lt;13 fit outfield 1st team players &amp; game postponed - also fine

3) &lt;13 fit outfield players &amp; are made to play (despite other postponements such as Leicester-Burnley) - not fine.

Burnley away off due to Snow ❌
Brighton due to 11+ Covid cases at Spurs ✅
Leicester due to Covid cases at Leicester ❌

Burnley v Leicester wasn't going to be on TV in the UK. Tottenham v Arsenal was due to be the Super Sunday showpiece.

Wonder why Sky Sports Gary Neville only seems to care about the Arsenal request and not an actual postponement...

Leicester had games postponed against Everton &amp; Burnley this week as "The club do not have the required number of players available (13 outfield players &amp; 1 keeper) due to COVID, injuries &amp; players at AFCON."

Media said nothing about Leicester, different story when it's Arsenal.

Arsenal lodged a reluctant request very early evening, almost late afternoon, to postpone due to literally being able to field a team of defenders and Eddie Nketiah. 

This will be an argument with SKY.

Gary Neville can fuck off.

Arsenal will get loads of negativity.

Shame we weren’t due to play Burnley this weekend and them lot next weekend. Then Burnley done us a favour.  Be no uproar then

Why does FPL’s own site announce postponements later that some others (eg LiveScore)? Annoyingly, I made an almost last minute decision to bring Maddison in not realising the Burnley game was off😡If I miss out on being overall winner by a couple of points I’m going to be fuming

Burnley’s game was cancelled because they said they had injuries and covid (let’s be honest it’s also because their best player is at AFCON and they just sold Chris Wood). Again, not a peep from @GNev2, @Carra23 or anyone else in the media suddenly piping up and making a stand.

Burnley sold Chris wood and had their game postponed. I guess they should’ve waited until after their game to sell him like we should’ve with AMN. 

Maybe they should’ve stopped cornet from going to Afcon too like we should’ve. One big joke.

Burnley can sell their CF but then call off a game as they don’t have any players? #clarets #lcfc I’m not having a go at Burnley far from it, but this can’t go on surely. #squads

The league need to be consistent with the postponement of games due to covid. Liverpool has 1 case and were allowed to postpone. We had 3 against Burnley and had to play. Leeds have struggled and have had to play and they don’t moan about it. NLD should go ahead!

The new Saudi owners of Newcastle United have a lot of money. 

They're in a relegation battle against Burnley.

So for £25 million they acquire Burnley striker Chris Wood who doesn't fit into their system but now at least won't play for Burnley.

Can’t say I’m surprised at Burnley getting their game postponed. Clearly just reporting false positives, in order to buy themselves some time to finalise loan moves for Andy Carroll and Delroy Facey. They’re making a mockery of the integrity of this competition

Holy fuck, sky sports are a joke, loads of games called off, Arsenal apply to have a game called off and there is a massive reaction. That reaction is to Arsenal only, the Burnley Leicester postponement is not cited. 

And there is no anti Arsenal bias…right?

If they win them they'll be 1 point behind us

The NLD will not get postponed. This will be due to the media going nuts about the Request from the Arsenal. Just one question what about Burnley selling a player and the next day getting their weekend fixture called off. How many games have Leicester got postponed https://t.co/3uuZZePkQ1

• Leicester.

• Burnley.

And others have all been postponed due to Covid, INJURIES &amp; AFCON.

Literally nothing said about any of those above. The minute it’s Arsenal though… 😂

The PL have let Leicester call their game off against Burnley this weekend for exactly the same reasons that Arsenal have asked for. No reason they won’t accept the postponement based on that.

Ended up buying Fernandes for Salah 🤭 Was out at the deadline so didn't have time to think

But with the Burnley postponement, would've had Ramsey (MUN) and Dawson (LEE) SGW starters, so thought an extra -4 down the line was worth it.

Who’s got Covid from burnley? Who had Covid from Leicester? Leicester was the most obvious one they had no defenders and no strikers. Sky stay quiet but when Arsenal now say they can’t field a team all the media create a story. It’s a disgrace how this club gets treated.

It’s getting ridiculous, how have Burnley been able to sell their striker for 20m then request a postponement the next day due to insufficient number of players. 1/2

Even if Watford don't end up doubling, Newcastle is a great fixture &amp; I think it worth armbanding Dennis in case they do. PL will pressure Burnley to play for sure

Good luck everyone 😀👍

A successful trip to #Liverpool by BET Sophie to collect a new and rare piece of #BurnleyEmpire memorabilia donated to the archives. We hope to display this in #Burnley later this year. https://t.co/tYyKrc8fv4

Palace were the first to fully take the piss, then I’d say us and Liverpool and now Arsenal and Burnley. That’s just off the top of my head, I’m sure every club would have by now

If @Arsenal and others bottle (Burnley etc) this weekends game then the league is fucked, West Ham played all their games in November and December barring a postponed game to Norwich, their fault, wi' a full injured back line and a few out wi' covid. Corruption in flow #COYI #oh

Burnley have games called off every week for similar issues, so if they don’t grant our wish then the agenda is clear. #afc

Burnley, Leicester, Wolves (against us btw) have all had games suspended coz of this 13 first team player rule. This is on the PL stupid rules https://t.co/i7DIwkH3FP

A starting 11 like that just last night? And now they want a game calling off? Surely rejected. 
But hey let's go back to bashing Burnley https://t.co/xTAoKaSqLX

Antonio and Son -&gt; Ron (c) and Mount for -4. No midfielders i really like, so i just figured i’ll take a two week punt on mount. 
Not that hyped on ronaldo either, but with the burnley fixture for dennis in doubt i really didnt see any other captain shouts https://t.co/nbgMuhWzps

Arsenal send a player out on loan to Roma but ask The Premier Lge to postpone their game due to lack of players

Burnley sell a player for £25million but can't raise a team 2 days later due to lack of players 🤔

PL fault tbh. Should have been clearer + I wonder if Norwich/Watford/Newcastle will complain about how many games Burnley have in hand. 

Burnley are probably gonna be 6/7 games behind the current matchday soon which is wild. https://t.co/pTvWbSOr36

No doubt clubs are now cheating, claiming Covid exemption without due course. Burnley sign striker to nufc 24 hours later they can’t field a team for their Saturday fixture.

Its strange how burnley lose their main striker, have a pot off money as a result to spend but call the game off for covid and there is no uproar on here? If ever you needed prove there was an agenda against #nufc stuff like this proves it.

Going with ronaldo instead of Dennis for fear of the Burnley game getting canceled.

So Burnley are looking to sign Andy Carroll as they no longer have a striker.

GW22 🔒
Son ➡️ Maddison.
Got burnt FPL style going too early to preemptively fail on a 0.2m swing. In the end I don’t know who I would replace Son with, so we move.
🧢 Sanchez, go you good thing. I’m weary of Burnley vs Watford. No Ronaldo, we pray 🙏🏼 
Good luck everyone #FPL https://t.co/MRC3sXQ4EV
