This list is even flawed because Liverpool youngsters were named to fill up the numbers but not City's? Where's Cole Palmer that played and even scored in the UCL this season? Liam Delap, James McAtee? This argument can fly for Chelsea but not Liverpool. https://t.co/L0SeXt5ohr

After the Liverpool game, I'll be shouting for West Ham.
Would like them to get 4th.
Not for love of them, all credit to David Moyes;
more a total dislike for the three teams behind them.

Now that's that's unbiased pundit. He's not an Arsenal fan or a former Arsenal player. Neither has he said that the frustrations of opposition is wrong. But he's said it right that everyone would do it and have done it. Liverpool did it, Leicester did it &amp; it'll be done again. https://t.co/rS5nDhN0hX

Another big performance from the lads today who again have shown there level by knocking out a team from the Southport prem. Best team we've played this season. 2-0 up at HT but @HalsallFC2 came strong 2nd half and got one back. The lads seen it out and are in the hat.

John Berger is spot on with this quote although I think weather has an influence if not demography. I see Bahia as a mother's lullaby and Liverpool like Lisboa as a sailor's wife expressing a deep longing for what never happened. London is a desperate man in a bowler hat. https://t.co/4xsYcXqgK1

Mbeumo and Baptiste need to drive at the Liverpool defence when Brentford have possssion, make their defenders challenge as only one of them is a pure defender, two are wing backs and the other is not at the level for a top 4 team #LIVBRE #COYB

We've gotten both City and Liverpool now out of the way, time for us to focus on the rest of the season. We must win the carabao cup and I'm expecting us to win all of our next games in the league, 48 points out of 48. Also for us to reach the semis of both UCL and fa cup.

Liverpool have received a card at home in their last 8/10 EPL games. 

Brentford have received an away card in their last 9/10 EPL games.

Having a small nibble on this and it won’t be tracked 🤞🏼

What shocked me the most about the Coutinho to Aston Villa move is the fact that beside Man City and Liverpool (for political reasons) which team in the epl is this man not starting in.

#LiverpoolFC will be without Mane and Salah. The pair have scored almost 50% of Liverpool's league goals. This is what Jurgen said regarding his team selection.

Liverpool have won just 1 of their past 6 games in all competitions; none of their last 3 in the Premier League.

The Reds have dropped points in 5 of their 7 matches against London opposition this campaign.

Klopp’s team have dropped 10 points from winning positions this season.

Seeing a lot of spurs fans comparing our chairman to villas. If purslow was so great would he not still be at Liverpool? Yes granted they have been busier then us this jan. But if you look at the summer we actually spent more money then them if you include romero ob to buy.

This is the first time Liverpool are hosting Brentford in any competition since March 1989, a 4-0 win in an FA Cup quarter-final tie. They last hosted the Bees in a league match back in October 1946, winning 1-0.

1989 - This is the first time Liverpool are hosting Brentford in any competition since March 1989, a 4-0 win in an FA Cup quarter-final tie. They last hosted the Bees in a league match back in October 1946, winning 1-0. Uncommon.

Good win for the boys today, could have been better in spells but will take the 3-0 win. 

Onto next week in the Liverpool Premier Cup QF against Kensington Fields.

Brentford will attempt to press the play to prevent Liverpool from simply sustaining pressure &amp; controlling proceedings as a result of that &amp; although that makes complete sense it also opens up the opportunity for Liverpool to score in another facet of play by playing through it.

Klopp told us Minamino is one for the future. I doubt it. The Ox preferred to him in Liverpool's front three. Ox should be in that midfield in place of Henderson. Anyway, hoping for a win

The difference between Liverpool and Man City is that there isn’t a single player on that team who would end their season if they got injured. If VVD, Salah or Trent get injured we’re finished

Some Liverpool fans would prefer us ALL to be cheerleaders . Completely ignore what we see on the pitch , express no views whatsoever and Just say everything in the garden  is  rosey .  I don’t think that’s for most of us and definitely not for me

Salah’s situation at Liverpool is now a very weird one. Do you upset the wage structure and possibly future FFP rules to keep him? Or do you sell a player on his last contract at 29 years of age and look to replace him with 3 other players? Tricky.

Chelsea have played Liverpool and Man City home and away this season, and they seem to be biggest issue, so if we really know what we are doing as a team, the next 5 game should all be a win, otherwise we might lose top 4 spot.

Liverpool are at 78% to beat Brentford (7%) today despite Mo Salah and Sadio Mane being at #AFCON2021.

In their absence, Diogo Jota is the 20% first-scorer favourite. Trade #LIVBRE 👉 https://t.co/5cW5f8Vavc #LFC #BrentfordFC https://t.co/1xK6rcIrHe

Looks like a much better balanced side for Liverpool today. Jota on the left, Ox pushing wide right to let Trent come inside, and Curtis providing a bit move flare from the middle of the park. Hopefully means Hendo can be back to being Hendo and not trying to force it. #LIVBRE

For the people calling the PL a farmers' league, context:

Chelsea had an injury crisis since October and drew a lot of matches due to that, Liverpool lost their main guys to AFCON (not an excuse but still)

While in the other leagues like France and Germany, the gap is inherent.

Want to know the difference between Liverpool and Manchester City? 
Look at Liverpool's bench this afternoon and compared it with Manchester City's bench yesterday. 
It's about investing in the playing squad. FSG has to wake up.

Annoying how these people played well without Lukaku. 

Pulisic was praised against Liverpool.
Ziyech was praised for his vision against Tottenham.

I'm so envious of Liverpool having Curtis Jones in their roster. This might sound far-fetched to some; but I honestly think he's such a talent and is exactly the sort of player we could use at Chelsea. He reminds me a lot of Bernardo Silva. Wish we could steal him

Counterpoint, putting aside tribal shit for a moment: MUFC are the club that the worst parts of LFC Twitter think Liverpool is - a club run by asset strippers who only give a shit about performances as long as the money keeps rolling in https://t.co/3BuoyNG7Ez

Why has it taken Arsenal to get a game postponed for you to start talking about it? @GNev2 @Carra23 I respect the both of you and enjoy watching you in TV, but it angers me that you only start talking now.

Is Newcastle buying Trippier and Wood, like when Liverpool tried to "moneyball" things and bought Downing and Andy Carroll because they were top in the "right" stats?

That Liverpool line up better be a 4-2-3-1 because the defence got run ragged last time thanks to the missing midfield. And put money on Jones to not get much done today because he'll get brushed aside easily. Probably why Minamino won't get off the bench either

Might do a Spanish team career mode next. Thinking Atlético but then they were in the same UCL group as Liverpool. Real Madrid might be too easy. Thinking Barcelona, Valencia, Sevilla or Villarreal

If you like at our bench and Leeds bench and even the teams: both hit by injuries and 1 or two covid cases. But both teams bringing academy players into the squad for the bench which is how it should be done. Yet little old Arsenal and Liverpool are incapable.

Is there no way they could have moved the kick off time of the Liverpool game so you got 2 televised games for a neutral point of view today?? Seems silly that you have two games kicking off at the same time but only the West Ham game being shown??
