Man City won all 4. Combined score 13 - 5. Brighton and West Ham scored consolation goals. Just a dodgy spell v Leicester - they were 4-0 up.

The Premier League create a new rule and set a precedent when they allowed injuries and AFCON to make up absentees.

Rival fans should be more angry at the PL than Arsenal, we don't make the rules and no one cared when Leicester got a game postponed for the exact same thing.

Unsurprising that this very valid outrage has only come after Arsenal are involved, despite the fact there was barely anything in relation to Leicester or United previous. Without getting conspiratorial, it seems Arsenal always become the eye of the storm in the British media https://t.co/6Ts0ss2Tko

Oh well. Honestly not too mad. We will win the NLD at home with both squads fully fit anyway. Now Conte gets more time training before facing a very well rested Leicester and we can recover from some injuries.

I actually agree with Neville on Arsenal postponing the game. Thing is … it’s absolutely right that it’s not about Arsenal .. the rule change is the issue, nobody blinked when we played Brentford with 4 covid cases in our first team … I haven’t heard a word about Leicester ..

City/United in 11/12

City/Liverpool/Chelsea in 13/14

18/19 with Liverpool and Man City

You could argue Leicester/Spurs as well in 15/16, but over the past decade, the Premier League has seen 3 title races and 1 of them was 10 years ago. 

How can anyone enjoy that?

COVID should be the only reason for postponement. Injuries &amp; AFCON are something all clubs have to deal with

When Leicester appeal to call off the Burnley with 1 COVID case and 5 players at AFCON no one bats an eyelid. 

When Arsenal appeal everyone complains.

The “13 senior members” rule is a joke but that’s on the PL, not us. They could’ve rejected our appeal. #AFC

Ironic Liverpool had an injury crisis last year (along with other clubs, Leicester being one) and we couldn’t postpone matching. 

Now, under these new laws you can postpone matches if you can’t get enough players.. These clubs are loaded with players. PLAY THE FUCKING GAMES.

Found out that Leicester’s also postponed for thé same reason. AFCON’s been on for what 20
odd years at least. This is just embarrassing really. Why didn’t they just call off the whole leagues till the tournament ended? https://t.co/HaLbpaiY5v

It seems every team in the Prem has  been allocated a one game no questions asked covid postponement exemption to be exercised at the club's own discretion. It was Arsenal's turn today. We'll be fresher for Leicester so not the worst thing.

Would like to effectively say that City are 2021-22 champions. painful to say. That world class finished destroyed any slight hope I had that we’d catch up to them. It felt like years ago when Kompany scored that winner against Leicester. This season they’ve done what we couldn’t

They couldn’t not postpone the Arsenal vs Spurs game after the precedent they set with the Leicester game.

They need to set out a new rule after this week and then they can change it.

Where was the uproar when Liverpool faked covid results to get a game postponed, when Spurs had several games postponed just after their new manager joined, when Man U fancied a break and when Leicester wanted to stop their poor form? Why didn't any of these play their kids?

Hes right though. Regardless of citys financial power. Klopp reached 3 finals before winning CL same season we finished 1 pt off top and shouldve won league without stupid draws vs west ham and Leicester etc. Being so far ahead in league we won it but didnt challenge rest of 🏆 https://t.co/r1hBwOYiD4

I think everyone overestimated how good Chelsea were going to be at the start of the season. The CL win glossed over bumbling into 4th and losing the FA Cup to Leicester. This is a dreadful performance from them so far.

Grealish was at his level at Villa. The top 6 are above that level. The next ceiling for him was a move to Leicester

It’s similar to Lingard at Man United. Trash but then was great at West Ham.

Arsenal are actively considering Tielemans. Important to note meetings with his agent were with a view to a summer move. Leicester prefer to keep him in January but Rodgers admits “he has to look at every option”. Somewhat opens door to a January sale if replaced.

Might regret capping CR7, but with Watford’s second game in doubt + my other doublers being defenders (I hated capping TAA against Leicester, just awful to watch), it was the logical choice even if he gets benched.

Three scenarios for the Arsenal game:

1) we have 13+ fit outfield 1st team players &amp; play- fine

2) &lt;13 fit outfield 1st team players &amp; game postponed - also fine

3) &lt;13 fit outfield players &amp; are made to play (despite other postponements such as Leicester-Burnley) - not fine.

But fast forward and he was on the outs for both club and country at Leicester City and Nigeria.

How many games is that Leicester have cried off now? It's getting to be a joke.

Gonna guess they're one of the club's where the younger players are refusing the vaccine.

All I heard when Leicester asked for postponement after being at the darts was “why shouldn’t they go out and enjoy themselves?”

The precedent was set when they allowed Everton v Leicester to be called off, not due to Covid cases. 

Any team can now request a postponement if they’re missing players! https://t.co/jZF0IAM01g

This outrage is so silly. Seen Leicester and even Burnley get games postponed due to injuries/AFCON/covid, but when it’s Arsenal it’s a problem. Media didn’t even question Liverpool when they pulled multiple false positives out their ass.

Burnley away off due to Snow ❌
Brighton due to 11+ Covid cases at Spurs ✅
Leicester due to Covid cases at Leicester ❌

Arsenal have 1 Covid case. The rest were in their control.

Have a feeling the PL isn’t going to accept the postponement request. Which is fine - except the fact it set precedent. Like everyone else is saying, yes we should play the squad we have etc. Again there wasn’t this outrage with Leicester, Liverpool etc.

Leicester had games postponed against Everton &amp; Burnley this week as "The club do not have the required number of players available (13 outfield players &amp; 1 keeper) due to COVID, injuries &amp; players at AFCON."

Media said nothing about Leicester, different story when it's Arsenal.

Where was all this indignation when Liverpool faked cases to postpone their game v Arsenal? Leicester have postponed 3 in a row and nothing was said.
Arsenal have the temerity to ask for a postponement and suddenly you've taken umbrage? Sounds very personal... https://t.co/85A0dFHXuE

I know I'm almost a day late in saying so but the new #Scream is an absolute blast if you're as big a fan of the series as I am, as was the lurid thrill of seeing a slasher @ODEONCinemas Leicester Square with an opening night crowd. A favourite cinema trip of 2022 for sure. https://t.co/4mKxQVYFp5

As if MP’s refer to how the PM got a deal through with Brexit and the so called economic recovery we’re making… 1/4 children in Leicester and 1/5 in Liverpool live in POVERTY and over 150,000 have DIED due to COVID-19. 

This government is arguably the most incompetent EVER.

City beat Chelsea today and they will win the league 
At start of season, I predicted City to finish 4th because of no recognized CF but Guardiola has proven me wrong 

City have been phenomenal 
Dominating Chelsea at SB, Leicester at KP and Liverpool at Anfield was top top

“We’re not having a dig at Arsenal…”

Silent last week when Liverpool faked covid cases to get our game postponed.

Silent when ~15 other PL games were postponed.

Silent when Leicester - Burnley was postponed TWO DAYS AGO.

But Arsenal have issues? Nah, force them to play 🙄 https://t.co/0a70oGfOVP

If you’re saying you miss ole, then you are the problem. You the representation of dropping standard. This fan base is getting dangerously closer to the Arsenal fan base with every day. He wasn’t good enough, he’s gone. Ppl forget 4-2 Leicester followed by 5-0 Liverpool at home.

I don’t think any games should be/have been called off but it’s hilarious the reaction when Arsenal ask. They should shut the training ground &amp; get 2 weeks off as the receptionist has tested positive. Or use a dodgy batch of LFTs. Or be Leicester and quietly never play again

I understand fans’ frustrations at Arsenal using AFCON as a reason for the postponement request, but they’re not the first to do that. 

Leicester did the same and had their request granted. How can you allow it for one club and not the other?

It’s all a huge mess.

We started with two center back from Leicester and a ligue 1 regular, midfielder from Arsenal, a forward who plays in the Premier league, a DM who has started every game in La Liga this season and a winger considered one of the best this season in ligue  1. 

Good base.

English titles in last 10 years:

- Man City - 5 titles 
- Chelsea   - 2 titles
- Liverpool - 1 title
- Man United - 1 title
- Leicester City - 1 title

Man City dominating England and serious challengers not in sight. Reason Chelsea can't afford to lose today's game.

FPL Musing

If Villa/ Leeds/ Leicester double in 23, Free Hit has to be an option, especially with those Man City fixtures.

Problem is these are all good mid-term buys as well which makes me open to a Wildcard as well.

Does anyone think if Leicester or Westham went in for any of our summer signings
Will they reject those clubs
We will keep overpaying for average players from 16th placed clubs like White
Or keep signing big club rejects like Odegaard
Until we get in an actual football coach https://t.co/Ohnppw7q75

Especially after Leicester’s players travelled 100 miles to watch the darts whilst cases were at an all time high.

A few leaks tonight that the NLD is going ahead. I don’t want to see games postponed but struggling to see how they can deny Arsenal when they allowed Leicester &amp; Burnley

They look very similar in terms of numbers + rationale

Lack of clarity from @premierleague is shocking

I just don’t get how you can call of Leicester less than a week ago for the same reasons but not us. Not gonna be a surprise that we’re the team rejected tho https://t.co/T1xH83svcz

I agree with Neville and Carragher.

The issue is, the Premier League let United and Tottenham postpone at a time when their new managers arrived.

#Arsenal have asked for one game to be postponed, AND Leicester vs Burnley is already off this weekend. #afc https://t.co/LLqgFRDXIn

I think prem started being shit the season after Leicester won it. 16/17 season onwards has been dead compared to the seasons prior

The premier league postponed Everton v Leicester "due to COVID-19 cases, injuries and players on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations." they set this precedent, if they reject our request we riot! https://t.co/NitqPHNI0w

Glad all football seems to be going ahead but I fail to see how this is much different to Leicester or Burnley https://t.co/AfxjltItJs

"the Leicester schoolgirl explained: "Boris Johnson told everyone to stay at home, but in lockdown he just went down to a party, in the lockdown. He's been naughty, so he had to go to the naughty centre to tell everyone he's sorry for going to a party in lockdown"." https://t.co/441wskbXWT
