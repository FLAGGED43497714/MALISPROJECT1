Have a table in dressing room starting now. 

Win 3 more than one of Hull, Reading, Cardiff to have a shout - laughable on current form but achievable if:

‚Ä¢ Retain key players
‚Ä¢ Make 3 quality signings
‚Ä¢ Deploy direct tactics

We shipped 4 goals, a woefully inept set of defending it's clear we've got a very thin squad. We desperately need some signings in the middle and a fullback @BarnsleyFC so we don't recreate this in the league.

Hi @BarnsleyFC can I ask have I been blocked from the FaceBook page after being politely critical and challenging of the obvious asset stripping thats ongoing by the club ownership? Can't seem to comment anymore.

Ollie Banks hit our midfielders early with some hard tackles to set the tone. Showed tremendous leadership when his team were down to 10 and almost pulled it off - they‚Äôd have deserved it. Our midfielders need to take a look in mirror and take a leaf from his book. #BarnsleyFC

At least half of the team and the manager are way, way out of their depth and need replacing asap with some experience and fight, something those in charge had better get to grips with pretty sharpish, if they don‚Äôt want to lose what‚Äôs left of the fan base.

To sum up; Barrow brilliant, Barnsley woeful and saved by Carlton Morris, Vita shows why he hasn‚Äôt played a game up until now and Kitching backs up my opinion that he isn‚Äôt ready to play yet. In the end lucky to progress and still terrible. #FACup #BarnsleyFC #BRNBRW

Ridiculous game of @EmiratesFACup football at Oakwell, one of the most extraordinary games I‚Äôve ever seen. #BarnsleyFC win 5-4 after extra time against 10-man Barrow. Poya Asbaghi gets his first win, the Reds get their 3rd win of the season. Again, ridiculous.

Barnsley versus Barrow is in extra time, tied at 4 all, and I‚Äôm researching Barnsley fun facts. Did you know it‚Äôs the home of the Barnsley Chop? @BarnsleyFC https://t.co/twlWH6y6p5

This has got to be the end of the line for Asbaghi @BarnsleyFC  
Losing the second half 4-2 against 10 men is bad enough, but against a team in 20th position, 2 divisions lower?
This is not Sunday League.

Early chance for the Reds as Callum Brittain cuts in on his right foot and fires towards the top corner, but Paul Farman tips his effort over the bar.

I genuinely think there‚Äôs more away fans than home fans at Oakwell today (if not very close). If the owners don‚Äôt see what they have done to this club today they never will. Expect this to be a regular occurrence if things don‚Äôt change. #bfc #barnsleyfc #conwayout #FACup

Lots of fans saying they aren‚Äôt going today cause they don‚Äôt feel a connection to the club (and that‚Äôs their choice) but imo it‚Äôs cause we are playing Barrow. If we had a PL top 6 team all 3 stands would be open #barnsleyfc

It's tough at the minute for Barnsley FC, who are seeking to avoid slipping on a banana-skin against Barrow.

Jordan Williams has known it worse heading into an FA Cup tie and here's why.

Tie 27 pick: @BarnsleyFC 2-2 @BarrowAFC (Barnsley on pens). Did you know (per @FACupFactfile) that Barrow have appeared more times in round 3 than any other club w/o a single 4th round appearance? I expect that to remain the case. #FACup

I think the already at times toxic relationship between @BarnsleyFC fans and the clubs hierarchy, is about to become irreparably damaged this month.

There is very much a sense of all fans feeling less connected than ever to our amazing football club.

Sad times.

Barnsley left-back Ben Williams looks likely to be the first to leave this transfer window. The 22-year-old is close to a permanent  move to League One Cheltenham. But it's not a done deal just yet.
