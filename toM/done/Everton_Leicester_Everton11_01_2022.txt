If Everton want a cheap Calvert-Lewin backup they should look at Elijah Adebayo from Luton Town. He's 24 with his contract up in the summer and has 10 goals in the championship so far this season. Similar build to Calvert-Lewin too, 6'4 and he's not slow.

Aston Villa have been working for days to sign Lucas Digne. They've always been frontrunners - Chelsea out of the race 🇫🇷 #AVFC 

Talks on, not 100% agreed yet between clubs. El Ghazi  also been discussed - nothing agreed on this point as Everton want cash. Next week will be key.

Moshiri will lead the demise of this once great club into misery.

Everton WILL NOT EVER improve W/ Farhad Moshiri at the reigns.

Things need to change, Farhad. Listen to the fans.

After doing some sensible business already in this window, it would be silly for Everton to spend £15 million on El Ghazi.

No better than what they have already out wide and there are areas of the squad that need much more pressing reinforcement.

At least he's outscoring all my Everton players.

I like how the game between Everton and Leicester that was supposed to be played today was postponed because of the exact same reason as our game and no one has said a god damn word about it

Liverpool are just the biggest club in the country, it's undeniable.

Wow, just seen that #AVFC will be paying Digne 150k a week 😳

Considering Rafa Benitez banished him from Everton for “putting his own interests above the club”, is he really the right type of character? 

Adding Coutinho to the mix, Villa could be a QPR in waiting! 😬

I dont agree @Sjopinion10 
Other sports seem to manage just fine - rugby league only uses it during TV games and the same with domestic cricket.
If there was a howler at a ground that has VAR then everyone would be asking why it wasnt being used 
ps Everton were denied pens ! https://t.co/Sj5woIfYyS

If our style of football continues much longer and with better players getting pushed out the club for speaking up over it, an unrest continues between the fans, it’s going to get to a stage where kids wont want to go to the games, sort this mess out @Everton

French slant on Lucas Digne to Aston Villa. Definitely wants to leave #EFC and has an agreement with Steven Gerrard's side. Villa 'serious' about a move, deal worth €30m or slightly less.
