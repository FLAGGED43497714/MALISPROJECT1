Corner Fulham. Laurent hacks away a pretty weak cross. Probably didn't need to but nerves are somewhat understandeble.

Laurent makes an inexcusable pass across goal, however Fulham‚Äôs high press is outstanding. That‚Äôs a well drilled and well coached team. Each player knowing their roles.

So close for Wilson! All pretty simple for Fulham. Starts with a throw, Mitrovic then heads it down to Kebano who just about gets the ball to Wilson, he drops his shoulder nicely to get in behind but his shot on the stretch dribbles wide. Chance that.

Andy Carroll has just shanked a shot from 30 yards but the spin on it has somehow turned it into a worldie pass. Dele-Bashiru's cross is dealt with by Fulham.

Reading may find it difficult to get on the scoresheet here. Fulham's quality of chances conceded has decreased substantially when going ahead in their last 4 away games.

Fulham in a 4-3-3, with Reed at the No 6 and Cairney and Carvalho in front of him. Reading look to be a 4-2-3-1, haven't seen too many of those this season....

We had gazzaniga at the club 4 years. Got rid and he‚Äôs on the bench for Fulham. What‚Äôs the point?
We might as well just have our two oldest academy goalies on the bench and if they don‚Äôt break in sell on.
The money this club wasted.

Betfair have some good odds (see tweet below) on the game.

Don't do them elsewhere at lesser odds just not worth it.

Victory tonight would see them back in the top 2

Tuesday night, under the lights, it feels like a massive game, again! All I want is a reaction. Fulham is a tough gig at any stage, in any form, but show some balls, aggression and some appetite to play #readingfc @willow1871 üôèüèºüíô

Fulham despite being 3rd, maybe there for the taking tonight? 4 draws in their last 5 league games. Last league win at Barnsley in Nov. #ReadingFC have only won 2/9 since October. Or is this just the cursed tweet stat and Fulham find form? BIG STATEMENT needed.

Seeing Mitro name dropped a lot, all I'll say is Fulham struggled for goals in the PL to the point they had to bring in more attacking players as Mitro wasn't doing it, so why would he be different for us? #NUFC

#readingfc Fulham have been good early on in the season but the last six games have dropped off. The team will be difficult to breakdown but the worry is they want revenge. Will Fulham's form improve today or will RFC take advantage? No matter the result the boss has to step down

I spent my 3 months in the UK living in Reading. Nice city with couple of decent coffee shops/pubs that are nowhere near the Madejski. Nothing is near that ground.

Supposed to be going to London for a mates 40th on the weekend but he's just got covid.

I'm over the moon to be honest.

Six hours on a Megabus to watch Fulham v Bristol City then go for a game of darts was not very appealing.

This incredible lady is Bridgit A Sam-Bailey. A genuine tour de force from my time at St.Marks School in Fulham. A really wonderful and memorable educator. A real icon for equality and diversity in education.

Just watched back Fulham's goal against #NFFC U23s and it's a harsh one. 

Gibson-Hammond and Swan have a mix-up on the touchline; Bowie snatches the ball, chips it over Back's leg as he tries to close off the angles and the striker runs away to score.

The #ReadingFC team I would start tomorrow vs Fulham. 

Southwood
Holmes, Moore, Dann, Bristow
Drinkwater
Laurent, Rino
Swift
Hoilett
Carroll

If Moore isn't fit, Tetek goes RB and Holmes central. A diamond MF with Hoilett off Carroll. A defensive focus.

So, what a weekend for #readingfc üò≤ As far as I understand, Paunovic will be in charge for tomorrow's game vs Fulham. Just hoping, somehow, the team can somehow pluck a performance out of nowhere and put in a respectable display at the very least

A rusty win at Ashton Gate, but minutes in the tank for players who will be needed for the packed fixtures ahead. Particularly with transfers likely to centre on those heading out than in. #FFC

The Invincibles going out UCL to that Chelsea team in retrospect gave Mourinho a fucking career. We beat that Chelsea and that's our best chance of a UCL trophy cuz both Monaco and Porto wouldn't be anywhere near our class. Gazprom upon Fulham FC embarrassingly lose to Monaco.

Jack Robinson- people seemed to have forgotten about Fulham however he cost us with too many mistakes, who knows what this month holds for him 

Enda stevens- Best left back at the club gets far too much stick , most people have so much hate for him , yes he was poor at start

#FulhamFC #FFC probably the best free transfers Fulham ever had. Brought in bt Malcolm Macdonald, his contribution to what was close to be our promotion season was immense. Great ball control and a superb passer of the ball. Sadly our awful chairman let him go for just ¬£147K... https://t.co/Cmp5vGMCIT

Manchester City are writing to the FA demanding to know why they never got Kidderminster or Borehamwood at home. 

Fulham at home is not acceptable, the letter goes on to state.

I watch Anguissa week in week out dictate play in the Napoli midfield, man's good... 
Makes me wonder what really happened with him at Fulham https://t.co/oekxwcTN4O

Fulham away to City. What a toilet draw. Bet it's live on the Monday night. Fulham to let in a comedy goal inside 10 minutes and then City reserves rack up 1200 passes.

He actually balled wella when he was at Fulham, Fulham was just leaking goals. Glad he's playing in a better team now https://t.co/QgLkjoUX1l

What a draw for Kidderminster!!
This one has to be on TV instead of a useless tie like Man City vs Fulham or Everton vs Brentford https://t.co/zkxB63C0XV

Shame about Jack Robinson today from what I‚Äôm gathering about his poor shift. Shame?
Because he was excellent at Fulham, really excellent, then subsequently denied repeated opportunities to build on that confidence boost he should‚Äôve got from that night.

A disappointing result but many positives to take! A crazy 15 minute spell in the second half cost us and Fulham were clinical. We work hard and learn from it!

Great to have @LarkinKellie and Ruby Atkins completing 90 minutes and @Chloe_wincheste getting on the score sheet! üêØ https://t.co/Kg4zVIhZge
