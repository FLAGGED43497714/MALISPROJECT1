Corner Fulham. Laurent hacks away a pretty weak cross. Probably didn't need to but nerves are somewhat understandeble.

Laurent makes an inexcusable pass across goal, however Fulham’s high press is outstanding. That’s a well drilled and well coached team. Each player knowing their roles. We are at sixes and sevens, totally lost. There’s four Fulham players between our CB’s and CM. #readingfc https://t.co/74EDf8Wl4w

So close for Wilson! All pretty simple for Fulham. Starts with a throw, Mitrovic then heads it down to Kebano who just about gets the ball to Wilson, he drops his shoulder nicely to get in behind but his shot on the stretch dribbles wide. Chance that.

17' Almost an opportunity for sub Camara - Swift flights a cross into the area, which Carroll nods on, but he can't quite get it under control under the attention of the Fulham defence.

13' GOAL! Reading 0-1 FULHAM

Reading may find it difficult to get on the scoresheet here. Fulham's quality of chances conceded has decreased substantially when going ahead in their last 4 away games.

We had gazzaniga at the club 4 years. Got rid and he’s on the bench for Fulham. What’s the point?
We might as well just have our two oldest academy goalies on the bench and if they don’t break in sell on.
The money this club wasted.

Betfair have some good odds (see tweet below) on the game.

Don't do them elsewhere at lesser odds just not worth it.

Torino’s asking price the last time we loaned Ola Aina of 15m is a bit wayward, but there’s a good defender there &amp; showed it today at RB for Nigeria vs Egypt. Coped well being shifted positions in a relegated side, surprised he wasn’t picked up like Fulham’s other loanees #ffc

Team news at 7pm. The first of four games in 11 days as #FFC seek to reclaim a top two spot. Reading won the reverse fixture 2-1 in September, although Fulham managed a 4-1 win the last time they were here (Mitro and TC at the double).

Fulham are the highest scorers in the EFL - 
but they haven’t gained maximum points since November !
Victory tonight would see them back in the top 2
Reading are just above the drop zone - and need to recover from their humiliating FA Cup exit

Am I the only Town fan pleased Fulham away was brought forward!? Grand Central from Brighouse cheap as chips, back home at a better time and not a silly ridiculous early start. Usually a pain finding a GC train back at decent time but this works perfect, jobs a good un! 🤷🏻‍♂️ #htafc

Fulham despite being 3rd, maybe there for the taking tonight? 4 draws in their last 5 league games. Last league win at Barnsley in Nov. #ReadingFC have only won 2/9 since October. Or is this just the cursed tweet stat and Fulham find form? BIG STATEMENT needed.

We’ve got a very tough match coming up against a talented Fulham team. 

We know we can beat them as we got our now traditional win at their place earlier this season. 

Our defeat at the weekend was a massive low but let’s hope we get a result tonight. I’d take a draw right now. https://t.co/5OcNvoXPJZ

#readingfc Fulham have been good early on in the season but the last six games have dropped off. The team will be difficult to breakdown but the worry is they want revenge. Will Fulham's form improve today or will RFC take advantage? No matter the result the boss has to step down

Matchday! Fulham at home. With the pressure mounting on Pauno, we can’t really afford to lose today if he’s hoping to stay for much longer. Tough game, but we beat them at their place back in Sept, so same again tonight on home turf pls. Prediction: 2-2 + Hoilett goal #readingfc https://t.co/IThmUOlKUk

As Villa seem to be negotiating to buy Luca Digne from Everton, I wonder if Fulham could get back Matty Targett if we are promoted.

In the last three transfer windows we would have 

Signed Lukaku (snake)
Payed money to get back Emerson
Loaned Saul 
Signed an Ex Fulham keeper 

That’s it that is all the business the European champions have done in the last 18 months

Interesting thing in this- Fulham have the best xG when going behind of any team in the league, but have only picked up one point while behind.

Just a matter of time before the problem fixes itself? 🤔 https://t.co/ki2NSR3WV7

Just watched back Fulham's goal against #NFFC U23s and it's a harsh one. 

Gibson-Hammond and Swan have a mix-up on the touchline; Bowie snatches the ball, chips it over Back's leg as he tries to close off the angles and the striker runs away to score.

Leeds U23 (even) .5u ✖️
Everton U23 (+110) .5u ✖️
Aston Villa U23 (even) .5u ✖️
Fulham U23 (+110) .5u ✖️

0-4, -2u

Sweep yesterday to reverse sweep today, there's a reason my standard bet is .5u...8 PL2 games and not one had 2 in the 1H...crazy.

Reading are 5/1 to beat Fulham tomorrow, which for those of you who don't know betting means if you put £10 on Reading to win. You lose £10. #readingfc

The #ReadingFC team I would start tomorrow vs Fulham. 

Southwood
Holmes, Moore, Dann, Bristow
Drinkwater
Laurent, Rino
Swift
Hoilett
Carroll

If Moore isn't fit, Tetek goes RB and Holmes central. A diamond MF with Hoilett off Carroll. A defensive focus.

If Lucas Digne to Villa leads to a reunion of Matty Targett at Fulham, I don’t think I’d be able to contain my excitement, Him and Tete would be the best full back pairing in championship history

Shame about Jack Robinson today from what I’m gathering about his poor shift. Shame?
Because he was excellent at Fulham, really excellent, then subsequently denied repeated opportunities to build on that confidence boost he should’ve got from that night.
