The thing about @ManUtd, they have the same disconnect between the strike team &amp; defence that PSG have. Both Ralf and Poch want to play variations of GeGen press but the right players aren’t there or aren’t willing to join in. #bbcfootball

Hope it's 4231 or at the very least the very similar 442 again with Bruno as a forward in the Cavani link role and Cavani on the last line again but then that also raises the defensive demands on Rashford and Greenwood over a pivot but I rather that than Bruno as a wide 10 again. https://t.co/YWyOO8ZkPu

The way @ManUtd are treating VDB  is very unfair, the guy would really regret ever joining.

Have to say I’m surprised Dean Henderson isn’t in goal, but this must mean he’s getting a loan move in January or perhaps a permanent in the summer. 🤔

Villa are a top side, credit to Gerrard for what he’s done since he’s come in.

Going to be a tough one. Come on United! 🔴 https://t.co/gAw70182Oe

Not sure it’s the best balance across the 10 and 9 positions, but otherwise a line-up that should be much better at progressing the ball.

A week of training and an onus to bounce back in a competition that we really need to progress in this season, fingers crossed! #MUFC https://t.co/Padsp7oRs9

I am a big fan of Maguire, but i dont mind seeing him out of the team.When he's on the ball, he waits till he's being pressed before passing the ball, he gets to the ball a bit too late, and either loses it, or commits a foul, I've seen this happen 3+ times per game, has to stop. https://t.co/uLG6JQkqmo

At times feel for rangnick

He's asked to manage a club of manutd stature with 1 assistant he brought from mls but then i see him bench players like deano &amp; say he deserves it.

Had he gotten more &amp; better assistants, they would give him good recommendations.

It's complicated https://t.co/LMjP3yFgwK

Is Ralf the correct man to advise @ManUtd if he thinks McTominay is our best CM option? Donny should go fulfill his potential elsewhere at this point, and go this month! I'm so frustrated for him. McT is a Watford CB at best...

Still not happy with three strikers in the team, but this is my favourite selection so far from Rangnick– the best fullback pairing for a possession team, as well as Fred and Bruno returning to the side. Lindelof returning is a bonus https://t.co/zD65q06Hby

My god I can feel the Douglas Luiz dagger already in my soul, corner that de gea doesn't claim and he heads it home to put villa up 2-1 in the 75th minute. I can already see that scouse cu** dancing on the touchline. Please win @ManUtd https://t.co/utC5JXKfp1

So am realising the problem ManUtd players are finding with the coach is his consistent honesty. He promised to bring the "best available team". Here we are now. He's openly criticized them too! Real gem 💎

This line-up is giving me serious 4-2-3-1 vibes. Curious, and at the same time, excited and worried. Oh, the life of a Manchester United fan!🤩🥲 https://t.co/XIBqelM3RX

If I were on the @NUFC board, I'd be pushing hard for Newcastle to put in a combined bid of 40 million for both Martial and Donny. 
Two quality players whose time @ManUtd is coming to an end and who'll immediately improve the Toon squad massively.
