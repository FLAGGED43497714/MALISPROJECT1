If @stokecity do not give this guy a job coaching at the club, they will have failed him, &amp; us, massively.
Let's face it, whoever coaches us defensively right now is not doing well, so why not give Ryan that opportunity?
His passion and commitment alone would surely improve us. https://t.co/HIwZLH0Mr5

Went up against, and often got the better of, some of the best strikers around. Represented the club as if he was Stoke born &amp; bred.

I’m stuck for words on what to say here other than he was and is the greatest captain I’ve witnessed at Stoke City. My captain. If @stokecity have any sense, they’d offer him some form of role in the back room, either honorary or official, maybe a first official coaching role? https://t.co/8Xe6CYbkgg

A genuine legend, grew up at Utd, matured at Stoke, one of the finest centre half’s in the country. It was cruel how the back injury and subsequent leg break ruined him.

🤯 Emre Tezgel, is Stoke's new youngest ever player. The 16-year-old striker is 41 days younger than Peter Bullock was when he made his debut v Swansea in 1958.

The 90' result belongs to @bet365 that means a draw, although Stoke start as super favourites they don't win and don't lose either, it's after extra time that @stokecity will qualify.
So definitely avoid betting on @stokecity winning the 90'.

Sunday is a cup game.
A cup competition in which we have no chance.
A competition which we would be better of exiting now, given the injuries we have.
I wouldn't expect any of these to be playing, nor as many of our first team as possible.
We have far more important games coming. https://t.co/Y6jMmSL85M

Disappointing result but I’ve always said that I would get my hair cut after my 1st @stokecity goal. In memory of my late Grandad Stanley Wilmot, I’ll be donating to @DementiaUK. If anyone wishes to donate it would be greatly appreciated.

Big thank you to @stokecity General Enquiries. (Especially the person that took the call) The coat my daughter left in the away seats after the @dcfcofficial match, has arrived back today. Great work and thanks again.

https://t.co/inolw6JFXe the highlight of an otherwise very uninspiring display from @stokecity when we play with wingbacks the opposition deal with them. Yesterday however Preston’s were given the freedom of the @bet365
