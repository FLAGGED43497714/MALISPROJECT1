Chelsea and Liverpool are the strongest Carabao semi finalists. They should both reach the final. Spurs didn’t lay a glove on Chelsea in 2 matches. I doubt we’ll do much better. We’ll do well to escape with a narrow defeat tonight. I think we’ll get done 3-0. Happy to be wrong.

Just clocked that bogus Liverpool false positives and Arsenal agreeing to be even bigger underdogs is just setting up an epic David vs Goliath story for the all or nothing Amazon documentary.

I really hope somehow over the two legs we absolutely batter Liverpool. They cheated the system and everyone just stood by and watched while they got away with it. They have absolutely no shame.

Liverpool vs Arsenal - EFL Cup ⚽️

⚽️ 2U Play - Andy Robertson 65+ passes - 5/6 - Coral ⚽️

Has hit in 4 of his last 5 games, one that didn’t he was sent off on 77’. 

Hit in 3/4 against Arsenal, one that didn’t was subbed on 61’. 

Should hit if he plays 90! 

Who’s riding? 🤑

After Sunday's #FACup defeat to Nottingham Forest, the Carabao Cup is Arsenal's last realistic chance of a trophy in 2021-22.

We're five minutes from kick-off in the first-leg of their semi-final with Liverpool.

All these false positives, delay the match, play the FA Cup and field their strongest side. If I'm a Liverpool fan, I'm laughing cos they've just gotten away with murder.

🔴 Liverpool draft in Firmino and Minamino for Salah and Mané. 

⚽ Nketiah is up top for Arsenal, the @Carabao_Cup's top scorer with 5 goals.

🤔 Can Arsenal snatch a win at Anfield after their shock @EmiratesFACup exit to Nottingham Forest?

Listening to @bbc5live saying Liverpool must resign Salah, Mane and Firmino. Pretty sure one will leave this summer. The team need ls a degree of renewal. Origi and Milner are leaving.

Carabao final might be Chelsea v Liverpool. Chelsea won CL, previously Liverpool. City won PL, previously Liverpool. City top now. 

These 3 dominating football. United in transition. We have world class coach, have opportunity to challenge them but he need players!

It doesn’t need to be in the headline.  Surely that’s why you have your column below. However the headline makes the wrong inferences and seeks to highlight a negative for point scoring or so it seems. Don’t see similar points against United or Liverpool as two obvious examples? https://t.co/EyJGi4ZoPl

Twice before Liverpool have defeated Arsenal and gone on to lift the League Cup. They won 3-0 in a fourth-round replay at Anfield in 1981-82, and in 1994-95 Rush scored the only goal in a quarter-final clash.

If Takumi Minamino scores he will become only the fifth player to net in four successive Liverpool games in the competition, following Dalglish in 1980, Ian Rush (1982), Steve McMahon (1986) and Vladimir Smicer (2000-01).

With the exception of maybe swapping James Milner for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, this is the strongest team Liverpool can field right now.

They were 2nil down as well
They were 1 Var decision away from winning 3-2
BHA scored their 2nd goal without a single liverpool player touching the ball
Arteta would never reach those levels
Graham is simply a better coach than the Pep coneboy will ever be https://t.co/DvU4qzVmr3

Liverpool fans in my mentions asking ‘how can you think Klopp needs this’ after he just engineered a 1 in 8 billion false positive scandal.

Read the room. Klopp is under pressure whatever happens tonight. He knows it, just look at their bench. Self-preservation mode.

Faked COVID results to get their best players back for this game and somehow avoided a punishment. On the other hand you’ve got us with COVID but we move on

Absolute masterclass from Liverpool &amp; Klopp on how to set your team up for success. Lying about covid positive tests and then moaning about player safety. Then he starts that lineup as Odegaard actually tests positive. Hats off to you Jurgen, that's good work.

No matter how they play tonight, Liverpool will have won this off the pitch. 'False positives' have helped them swing the home leg first.

Anyway, we'll draw a line through it like Liverpool did with their antigen tests.

Arsenal to win (draw no bet) at about 3/1 is a good bet especially with the Liverpool players away in Africa.

True. 

He won a CL, an EL, and an FA Cup. 

During a period in which Liverpool won the League Cup.

Since Jurgen Klopp took over at Liverpool, they have scored 43 goals against Arsenal in all competitions.

That's more than they have against any other club in that time.

Will there be more goalscoring glory for the Reds against the Gunners tonight?

To say that Liverpool have pulled a fast one here would be one of the understatements of the year.

People complaining about Liverpool fielding a strong team r the same
people who complained Klopp disrespect cup competitions? Arsenal r also lucky they have 2nd leg at home which statistically make a huge difference. Other teams have had postponement from covid too #bbcfootball

One of the VERY VERY FEW times I’m rooting for Arsenal to win a game.

Only because I feel liverpool ran us local last week.

Shankly and Paisley had learned a great deal about European football which Liverpool would eventually turn into trophies. Their strategy in two-legged ties would be containment away and attack at home #LFC https://t.co/gKq76RPrL1

Well done to the fans who've travelled north. Looking at the two teams it's highly unlikely that we're going to get much out of this. We can but hope. Liverpool have put out virtually a full strength team. It is an absolute scandal. The FA are taking no further action. Corruption

It'll be an almighty test for Arsenal against Liverpool's press without Partey and Tomiyasu. It was a massive test which they failed even with that duo, but without them, I fear for the likes of Cedric and Lokonga in the build-up, particularly with Nketiah and Laca higher up.
