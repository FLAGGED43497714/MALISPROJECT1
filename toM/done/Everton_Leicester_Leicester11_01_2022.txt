Hirst is fairly poor isn't he? 🤣

He's costing #Pompey (reportedly) 5k a week, with Leicester apparently footing a further 7k 🙈

You'd just expect a bit more from him for what he's earning.

Happiest of birthdays to @vardy7 who was fantastic when he met my beautiful friend Hazel. Hazel sadly passed away not long after but never forget the pure respect shown to her even though he was the only Leicester player she knew 😂❤️🤍 https://t.co/B8ITT858nk

I see Dusart is in the 2m 6f novices chase at Leicester tomorrow. Good win there should see him line up in the Marsh against Bob in March. Certainly got the potential to succeed at 22f, and further in time, esp. given his Simonig link. Expect his ante post to fall to 8s tomorrow.

14:20 Leicester. Only Money. 3pts at 2/1. This lad goes back right handed. 1st time since his runaway win at Huntingdon (bt 110r rival 33l). 4lbs lower than season opening mark. 2nd at Newbury still ahead of 127r, 119r. Drop back in trip to 1.7f. Yard 3/8 in last 9 days.

Just think about where we'd be if we had owners like Leicester City who actually value the fans just as much as they value the club. Bin off these owners like Man City, PSG and Newcastle. 

All the clubs in the world, Leicester are the only ones I envy.

Aston Villa are the leading cause of contentious goal decisions. Hawkeye goal vs Sheff Utd, Lansbury v Palace, Bruno's stamp on Konsa leading to a penalty, Man City's offside goal, Aubameyang's penalty after half time whistle, JJ's "goal" v Leicester and now JJ's offside.

FT: 1-0 

⚽️ Iheanacho 

The Super Eagles had a much better first half, and Egypt grew into the match, but the first half strike from the Leicester City forward proved to be enough to get the win.

If leicester's owners can improve the stadium, provide a new training ground and even build a new fancy hotel by the stadium and still sign players why can't we? Top reds act as if those things are mutually exclusive. Look at the difference in sizes of the clubs too.

Right i’ve came to the conclusion we’re planning on beating Watford, which puts us 17th(depending on Burnley v Leicester) if we’re 17th we’re a more attractive fit then the club goes in hard for top targets thinking we look ‘safer’ &amp; momentum builds

City didn't make a mistake signing Iheanacho. He has that quality. Just their system didn't suit him.
Slimani on the other hand, Leicester were sold dreams there.

Ngl I’ve got to give signing of the season to ramsdale. The amount of abuse that guy got when he signed is fucking crazy. I’m guilty. His best game for arsenal is that Leicester away game. I remember watching it and thinking fucking hell! Amazing on the ball. Fair play to him.

Tigers only kicked the ball once more than Wasps (41/40) but Wasps showed a little more adventure in the second-half. The build-up to Gopperth's last penalty came from Hougaard's decision to run it back

I don't get this. Leicester got their match postponed "due to COVID-19 cases, injuries and players on international duty at AFCON."

Surely postponements should only be down to Covid?

I notice no clubs asked to postpone their FA Cup games...

Why are people calling for LFC to be investigated over Klopp being too honest on tests

But Leicester can postpone a game, players go to the darts, play a game then ask for postponement.

A club can only ask. Public Health England &amp; the EFL decide if request can be granted or not

As per Ben Jacobs via @CBSSportsGolazo; Arsenal are the latest club to show interest in  Leicester’s Youri Tielemans. In quote: I do know that Arteta admires Tielemans, so it is just one to watch to see if it gathers pace over the coming two or three weeks,” said Jacobs.

Mahrez played for a Leicester team that won the league and he won the PFA award.
Kanu did well by winning the FA cup with a Portsmouth team but I think Mahrez has eclipsed what Kanu has done. https://t.co/XDgw3qoRmf

I'm seeing people who genuinely want Hendo/Fabinho/Ox to be the midfield vs Arsenal. Everytime we've started with that midfield this season we've lost (West Ham &amp; Leicester). I'd play Ox on the right side and Curtis or Milner in the left side, but that's probably just me

What is difficult to understand about this? 14 fit players from the 25 man premier league squad. Got that? Leicester have 8 from that squad. Do your research. That’s why #lcfc played kids in the FA Cup. Rules for EPL are different. https://t.co/RoZu7RhZeT

We seldom have less defensive duties in the national team hence his Leicester presence isn't really felt, he should add more to ball winning and iron man exhibitions. https://t.co/0hO97N1rRT

but the players went to the Darts, knowing it could cause fixture cancellations

Few structural problems at Villa since Leicester (last time we played really well). As we’re so narrow we’re vulnerable down the flanks. Quick switches of play leave us 2v1, and then as players leave the centre to help, we leave gaps in the middle. It’s easy to exploit. #avfc

We only have 8 senior players fit including goalkeepers. It’s not our fault the premier league rules don’t allow us to play our youth players. Stop having an agenda at Leicester and look at Liverpool for once who faked covid results to have a rest https://t.co/5gK8XnpczK

Leicester, Watford, Leeds and many others had their games postponed, but Liverpool gets one where we even lose home advantage and everyone loses their minds and starts doing conspiracy theories

We are massive, we are the biggest club in England by far, no one can compare https://t.co/I9DKJZJDKE

Sometimes nostalgia blinds us.
What Mahrez did with that Leicester team in 15/16. I don't see Kanu doing that. And he's kept that level for years now. 
Idk why but Mahrez is somewhat disrespected on this app. https://t.co/O66152O9rJ

1. Leicester City TV. Great content can do attract people to you. Case in point: AS Roma Twitter. 
2. Leicester could create a channel on Twitch. AS Roma built great engagement with their Nigeria angle, they just couldn't capitalize. If they'd won a UCL, it could have been 🔥🔥 https://t.co/CFzHWAzYrD

It's weird how Leicester didn't think to give Iheanacho and Ndidi a TV show last season. 
It's a world of content, where actors and artists are getting radio and TV shows. 

Four years ago, Roma gave Szczesny a TV show on Roma TV. 

It was a no-brainer IMO.
