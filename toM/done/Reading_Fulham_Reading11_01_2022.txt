As a rule of thumb.... avoid reading or drawing conclusions from anything reported by secular media regarding the Pope's words or actions.

Go to https://t.co/keGBX7jy5i and find the entirety of the Holy Father's words unfiltered and untainted by worldly ideologies and agendas.

Wow. Reading all the doom and gloom about the Seahawks. Fire Pete Carroll. Fire John Schneider, trade Russell Wilson. While they had several issues this year, I believe it was an outlier. Seattle was somewhat hampered by cap and in the early part of the season a bad secondary.

All of life is a gamble, as every adult knows. 

Many people, probably most, are unhappy with this fact and spend their lives figuring out how to place as few bets as possible. 

Others, however, take the opposite route, and among these are the Swiss.

These people really want the virus to be more deadly as it suits their politics - she probably got a rush of endorphins reading that quote.

Just the same way some on the antivax side want more vax deaths as it proves their side right. https://t.co/m3p4km2nkg

Fire Force made me think about certain manga series that can become better if you've read another manga by the same author. There's no reading order cuz they are not canon to each other:

Billy Bat and 20th Century Boys
Fire Force and Soul Eater
Vagabond, REAL and Slam Dunk

I’m getting to a point where reading sentences without that-clauses is making me feel sick. “I think it’s a beautiful day,” “My mama told me I shouldn’t stay out late” just completely omitting the word “that.”  It’s making me feel sick! My brain is screaming and crying!

Reading still giving out Christmas gifts it seems. Absolute shocker. Pass across the face of goal (i think from Laurent) and Wilson taps into an empty net. That back pass was not even close to keeper Southwood. 0-1. #FFC

And reading that the new ‘richest club in the world’ are about to spaff £20m on Chris Wood.

13' GOAL! Reading 0-1 FULHAM

Reading may find it difficult to get on the scoresheet here. Fulham's quality of chances conceded has decreased substantially when going ahead in their last 4 away games.

I learned about Peltier after watching Thunderheart, and then reading about AIM &amp; the reality the movie alluded to
30 years later.
Even the original prosecutors say he is innocent
Pretty sure there are similar convictions where the accused have been released

reading any romantic subplot I write is going to be painful because my preferred romantic trope is URT (unresolved romantic tension) that stays unresolved and just gets murkier and deeper and more multithreaded until someone dies 💀

8yo and I are reading Narnia now (chronological order, his choice) and we got to the founding of Narnia today. Then had a long talk about analogy, metaphor, types and why we often can find Jesus (less obviously than Aslan) in stories bc they are all shadows of the great Story.

A helpful tip I heard for reading the news—

The modern world often defines “peace” in this way:

Within a country, peace is the percentage of all violence that is enacted by the state compared to what is enacted by private citizens.

when reading parshat hamon you can see that the hebrew word for ice cream comes from the aramaic word for frost… does this mean we’re supposed to eat ice cream in order for the segula to work?? i think we should eat it just in case https://t.co/hW0eMtSyaX

I have been reading the novel in bits &amp; pieces, finding myself skipping a lot of parts! I’m really banking on the fact that they said they will change parts of the novel, because if it’s anything like the novel I doubt I will get past episode 1. I don’t even know about VP 😶 Wow https://t.co/9WhQZikXiK

the correct reading of Licorice Pizza is that Alana doesn’t like men - she likes their attention, but she doesn’t like men. And Gary is a boy, she likes him, but in more of a sweet little brother way, but she doesn’t have the language to dissect her own feelings for any of them

That time when you are about 3/4 through a fairly stodgy book and it's dragging to the end but you really want to finish it because you have a pile of hopefully better reads waiting. Does anybody else feel me? #Reading #ReadingChallenge2022

Me: hey, I get addicted to everything  so I can’t take pain killers

Me at home, feeling reall nice, googling the pill I just took and reading “this medicine can be habit forming”. https://t.co/F7dKSsvxpH

Reading @Kotlikoff  new book Money Magic.  He has some counterintuitive takes. He encourages marrying for money.  Our feeling: marry for love but think about your financial future and stability. (And don't marry for not money or !money in computer parlance.)

👇Great advice!

We'll add: don't just read articles online. Pick up a book! Find yourself with a few spare minutes? (Waiting for a bus, an uber, or for the water to boil to cook dinner...) That's the perfect time to do some reading ;) https://t.co/8hnqGkV3BX

A must read blog in January. 

‘These aren’t just motions, they’re motions tied to metaphorical masts that will compel us to take the right action when temptation strikes.’ 

Really enjoyed reading this one. https://t.co/xXR6wAMspY

I added two boys to my book club and now we’re reading a book about fucking sleep. This is what happens when you add men into the mix.

A good first aid kit can be built cheaply and over time. Get your samples of over counter pain killers.

Hydrogen peroxide and alcohol

Gauzes, tape, and band aids

Spend time reading, use your library and your internet. Learn the basics of first aid
