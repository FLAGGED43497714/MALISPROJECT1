As a rule of thumb.... avoid reading or drawing conclusions from anything reported by secular media regarding the Pope's words or actions.

Go to https://t.co/keGBX7jy5i and find the entirety of the Holy Father's words unfiltered and untainted by worldly ideologies and agendas.

These people really want the virus to be more deadly as it suits their politics - she probably got a rush of endorphins reading that quote.

Fire Force made me think about certain manga series that can become better if you've read another manga by the same author. There's no reading order cuz they are not canon to each other:

Billy Bat and 20th Century Boys
Fire Force and Soul Eater
Vagabond, REAL and Slam Dunk

A helpful tip I heard for reading the news‚Äî

The modern world often defines ‚Äúpeace‚Äù in this way:

Within a country, peace is the percentage of all violence that is enacted by the state compared to what is enacted by private citizens.

Reading the comments in the trending topics about the senate hearing today is hilarious. Both mobs think their guy is winning. Which is likely true since both work for the state and all keeping the public at each other's throats does is benefit the state.

I think Facebook was the closest we all got to reading each other's minds. It opened up hidden areas of people's personalities to everyone that followed them. For a while people used social media like it was a personal diary/daily journal.

Why is it that when I read books, it's as if I put so much effort into reading a text that I forget what the text was even about? It makes reading pointless and I have to read it over and over again to understand it.

Reading @Kotlikoff  new book Money Magic.  He has some counterintuitive takes. He encourages marrying for money.  Our feeling: marry for love but think about your financial future and stability. (And don't marry for not money or !money in computer parlance.)

We'll add: don't just read articles online. Pick up a book! Find yourself with a few spare minutes? (Waiting for a bus, an uber, or for the water to boil to cook dinner...) That's the perfect time to do some reading ;) https://t.co/8hnqGkV3BX

A good first aid kit can be built cheaply and over time. Get your samples of over counter pain killers.

Hydrogen peroxide and alcohol

Gauzes, tape, and band aids

Spend time reading, use your library and your internet. Learn the basics of first aid
