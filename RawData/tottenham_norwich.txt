Heading for the exit? Reports out of #THFC reveal Conte is shocked at the shambles he’s walked into at #Tottenham and wants out at the end of his 18 month contract (or sooner). Conte reportedly refers to Kane as a ‘deficiente’ (moron) and a ‘pagliaccio’ (clown performer/muppet). https://t.co/5GxwxcIsf6

If any other player in football won the Golden Boot and lead in assists in the EPL, they’d have been top 5. Most hated player in football because he doesn’t do fancy flicks and has low pace on FIFA. #BallonDor #HarryKane #BallonDor2021 #THFC #COYS #Spurs #Tottenham #Football https://t.co/nwHQVzDcYr

Both @Fotmob and @SofaScoreINT gave Davinson Sanchez the highest rating of any Spurs player against Mura. Useless shite these player ratings are. Useless apps as well.

Burnley Vs Spurs match was postponed due to snow. I wasn't surprised at all. Spurs had problems in the past and continue to do so in the present time. Tbh, this season won't be all bright. Unless Big changes are made in the Squad. #thfc #spurs #Tottenham

You’d think with all the modern tech we have these days.. these people would be able to predict a massive snow storm was gonna happen. making the Tottenham fans travel 5 hours.. announce the lineups and then decide to call it off.. what a joke. #tottenham #burnley #epl

A joke that a premier league club don’t have under soul heating!!! Feel for all the fans that have travelled… joke of a club Burnley #tottenham #spurs



#BURTOT 

Snowy pitch, if match starts Footballer's stud grip quality will play a very crucial part. Sliding tackles will be similar to playing with fire, the tactic for #Tottenham should be ground passing and breaking through gaps left by Burnley in defence and midfield.



Wow! The first thing that struck me when I saw the team news today was how feeble our bench looks! There’s no inspiration at all!

Let’s hope the first eleven can get the job done early!!

Currently watching spurs arsenal from 2010 on SS1.

Forgot how amazing VDV and Modric were.

We really miss any creativity in midfield with the current team.

From what I heard from Contes speech. Let's be honest, we've heard all this before. I don't what to get carried away with all the Conte Hype. I never did in the first place. But I feel nothing is going to change at THFC. ✋

#Conte brutally honest on #Tottenham https://t.co/372uj9c7Xn



Following the defeat against NS Mura, Antonio #Conte is now expected to choose a similar lineup to his previous Premier League teams to start when #Tottenham travel to Burnley. With Son Heung-Min and Lucas Moura set to return to the team. @TelegraphSport https://t.co/QblZ3HtBv3



Nevermind "world class divas," just bring a few players to #tottenham with a passion for the game. #coys #thfc
