Illan Meslier is the youngest goalkeeper in Premier League history to reach 50 appearances. 

#leeds #meslier



163-139-17 YTD, add #BrentfordFC +0.5: no faith in #Leeds offense to score a goal w/o a penalty. Unbelievable to see them favored with null xG, but #LUFC seem less likely to score each match. #BeeTogether mixed results lately, but prefer their forwards and defensive focus #LEEBRE https://t.co/n6S1JMvPXT

Bamford back in the team Lets go #leeds https://t.co/498kUdF9Ke



All players playing in their proper position. Ayling back. Bamford back. Roberts hitting form. James playing well Home game. Most Confident ive been in ages. 3 pts #lufc #mot #leeds #LEEBRE



Raphinha has the highest goal/xG ratio in the Premier League this season, having scored 6 from just 3.2 xG.

Good luck to Brentford in their attempts to stop him this afternoon.

Do you know what a window period is? 

Each STI has an amount of time before it will show up in a test.

Chlamydia/gonorrhoea: 2 weeks
Syphilis: 12 weeks
HIV: 4 to 12 weeks

If you get tested before then there's a chance that your results will be inaccurate!
