We now look like Manchester United; playing poorly and relying on penalties to win mid table teams.



If it was Manchester united they'd have started calling us Pen-chester.



Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City all won today because of a penalty but you won’t hear about it because it’s not Manchester United. All 3 soft penalties. Joke.

Gutted, but to score twice away from home against a team challenging for the title is very admirable. Still six points clear and it’s very likely that Manchester United, West Ham United and Leicester will beat Norwich, Burnley &amp; Newcastle so hopefully the table will stay the same

No player is bigger than the club, not just at Manchester United but any club in the world, if you have a player or agent that thinks different or think that they should get special treatment then it's a problem.

No special treatments for Paul or Mino under management of Ralf!



I think some people needed reminding that it's not Pogba FC, not Martial FC, not Rashford FC, not Bruno FC, not van de Beek FC, not whatever player FC.
It's MANCHESTER UNITED FC and the club comes before anyone. Support the players but not over the club.
#ManchesterUnited



Manchester United got a 21 yr old talent for just £72million while we spend £100 mill on a fully grown man. Manchester United are better on the transfer market then us



I don’t tend to pay much attention to punditry any more.

Most pundits don’t look at the wider picture and what’s going on at Manchester United.

Rangnick’s main job is after his 6 months as interim manager, that’s where he is a specialist for that particular role.



Wow.. I thought watching Manchester United was frustrating and annoying, watching my son play with his friends is a new level of patience https://t.co/Kg2HSz1JQV

It wouldn't be the same in media for Manchester United if it's the one playing against 10 men for most of the match with only one goal nga it's Even a controversial penalty.



The whole Pogba situation should be clear, you as a player either want to stay at Manchester United or you don't, instead his so called agent constantly opens his mouth causing issues, well it will not work with Ralf Rangnick in charge... 

Sign the contract or get gone!

Other clubs have raiola players and there’s no issues, they get on fine, raiola is fine, even tho greedy and talkative, it’s Manchester United that get too bothered by him and don’t know how to handle him, he’s not one all powerful man https://t.co/2e10TKUYbK

Norwich City v Manchester United - the two new boys go head to head at Carrow road at 17.30, with Ralph Rangnick so far favouring an unusual 4 -2- 2- 2 formation. He needs the 3 points as much as Dean Smith. Should be one hell of a game. https://t.co/kK6rJ4wtdP

The Next Manchester United? https://t.co/fAwHAcaK63



Manchester United fans moaning about that penalty 😭

A) 47 pens in Oles first 150 games, more than any manager in English football history over that many games 

B) More of a penalty than the one that got him the job

Little self awareness needed.  Not our place

Hope this helps

Manchester United vs. Norwich chocan en Carrow Road por fecha 16 de la Premier League 2021. https://t.co/tO6XhHsRsB



Real Madrid are reportedly monitoring Cristiano Ronaldo's situation at Manchester United, believing a deal could be struck in January following Ralf Rangnick's arrival at Old Trafford.

#MUFC #RealMadrid #Ronaldo https://t.co/FDgE2Zo9zP



Jack Grealish costing Man City 100 million and doing nothing to justify that price tag is not spoken about too much. Oh wait,  he is not black and doesn't play for Manchester United.



The change of coach has been good for United, that today are looking for their third consecutive victory in #premierleague against bottom Norwich.

➡https://t.co/qMuvgOW44t



🔴🟡 This weekend’s meeting at Carrow Road might be a financial mismatch, but it was the men in yellow that pushed Manchester United all the way for the inaugural Premier League title...

Glory-Glory Manchester United



I belong to the 99% Manchester united fans who think cristiano Ronaldo will score today



Phil Jones is one hell of a professional. He's just going about his business not minding if he plays or not. 
I believe many people have forgotten that he's still a Manchester United player.



So Manchester United gave an unwanted man the job for the remainder of the season + consultant's role for 2 more years? Wow!

It's MANCHESTER UNITED FC and the club comes before anyone. Support the players but not over the club.

Today we start with a big singel play 10 units which is our max bet.
Manchester United to score over 1.5 goals against Norwich in The Premier League.
Odds 1.60.
We do not trust The Man U defense.
But Norwich defense is worse.
We trust Ronaldo and Bruno with help from Rashford. GL https://t.co/OzBBOeX8RK

Manchester United Preffered XI against Norwich tonight

Substitutions:

Lingard⬆️ Bruno⬇️
Rashford⬆️ Greenwood⬇️

Better to not play Ronaldo and Bruno the unnecessary last few minutes of the game.
Cavani back from injury and Lingard deserves minutes.

The double standards in the Premier League annoys me. This was how Cavani's goal was chalked off against Tottenham and now they are saying Sterling was protecting his territory but McTominay wasn't, against Son, right? It's always different with Manchester United with these lots.

Ralf Rangnick is creating the template of what Manchester United should be going forward. 

The club always should come first. https://t.co/8aIDpmxzmc



This is my Manchester United starting line-up. Who would you choose? https://t.co/3OwdJxyJZp via @bbcsport



Hope the board and the incoming CEO understand the best way for Manchester United to flourish as a business is the product on the pitch not individual players whose marketing performance for themselves is miles ahead of being consistently good enough or suitable on the pitch.

Ralf Rangnick explains what has most surprised him about Manchester United players https://t.co/4NrC1DoBNq



Ralf Rangnick is really hated in Russia after leaving Lokomotiv; however, the reason he's hated might help Manchester United because there are too many players with massive wages playing 10% of games. We criticize our owners for being businessmen first but they're bad businessmen

Rangnick will go down in the history of Manchester United...the man who made United a football club again😎



Hopefully they give him enough power to implement his ideas, which he really explains in an exciting manner.

I am sorry but I am not giving up on a 25 year old midfielder that has 150 appearances for Manchester United. He can be coached to limit/overcome his deficiencies. As far as work ethic, off-the-ball work, mentality goes, he's one of the best.



If Pogba leaves and we don’t sign Haaland, I’d genuinely be content with that as it means that Manchester United isn’t involved with the greedy, arrogant, money hungry slug that is Mino Raiola any more. #MUFC🇾🇪



Any Manchester United player who's not ready to play good football should please take the next flight out of Manchester.

Ralf Rangnick says it is not his job to convince Paul Pogba or any other player to stay at Manchester United.[Sky] #MUFC Manchester United



"He’s not the name on the back of everyone’s shirts but he can be the one that can hold it together.”

McTominay divides opinion among #MUFC fans but praise from within the club for a driven, passionate and versatile player is unanimous.

Since Arsenal decided not 2 participate in UCL, Bayern Munich made Barcelona a perfect replacement 4 Arsenal. But seems Barcelona will no longer be participating in UCL anytime soon. Manchester United should be next team to enter Bayern Black List 😂. Muller should register them.



Apart from Rangnick's Manchester United which other team is also losing today... 😎

#Football
https://t.co/KKRKNPqf7c



Wait Manchester United haven’t  lost in the last 5 games…….. now that’s surprising



Letting Pogba &amp; Martial leave in January isnt a problem.Better players left and Manchester United remains.

Just get good replacements &amp;wish them goodluck.
But I'm so sure both of them will not succeed in another team if they keep ds same level of mediocrity&amp;pride on the pitch.



Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick has stated that if Paul Pogba does not want to play for the club, he will not stop him from leaving next summer. https://t.co/1GbT2c2PPI



I have to admit I’m falling in love with Ralf Rangnick’s style of management, if a player doesn’t want to stay , let him leave. 

We should have players who are proud and willing to play for the club. We are Manchester United #GGMU
