This is a real fight now

You cannot come for how genuine a club city is 
As city has done FC Barcelona couldn't have brought 30k fans in div 2 if they tried 

You can bring the trophies argument all you like
City has more "hardcore" fans
This is beyond trophies https://t.co/8aqpYglJIV

Erling Haaland set to join FC Barcelona from Borussia Dortmund as expected, done deal and here we go #FCB

He joins Barca instead of Real because of the lure of being the main man instead of the sideshow or the duo which would have been the case if he joined real.

Here’s the thing; regardless of FC Barcelona’s prevailing quandaries, this club will *always* attract the very best footballers—along with Real Madrid. The name, the brand, the prestige—it’s simply impossible to overlook. 

If there’s one thing money can’t buy, it’s history.

Almost every major/important City backroom staff is from Barcelona. Your club wouldn't be in the place that it is without FC Barcelona. Your greatest manager loves Barca more than City. FC Barcelona will always be bigger than Manchester City.
Stay in your lane. https://t.co/eu7UOyooDD

Alvaro Morata will have made six transfers since 2014 totalling €270m if he joins FC Barcelona. During those seven years he has never scored more than 15 league goals. The only possible reason to explain these transfer fees is that he is being used for money laundering. #Barca https://t.co/nFmu6Nvic1

Christensen wants to play at the Camp Nou and be coached by Xavi Hernandez.

I was learning Pep Guardiola's methods to revolutionise FC Barcelona when he took over the job. Pep was inspired by the likes of Bielsa, Cryuff, and Michels. Working with graduates from La Maisa was one of his main strengths. And I think Xavi is currently following the same path.

What do we mean by cules? 

To find out the origins of FC Barcelona's nickname we must go back in time, to the second decade of the 20th century. ... From that time onwards, the supporters of the 'Azulgranas' came to be known in Catalan as 'Culers' or 'Culés' in Castellano, https://t.co/UgWoVEybHI

Time to give my thoughts on the Ousmane Dembélé contract situation at FC Barcelona. After months of waiting, it looks like Dembélé will now leave on a free at the end of the season, after demands of a €40M annual gross salary with a €20M bonus to the player. Disgraceful. 🇫🇷 https://t.co/nrumRzEhYv

FC Barcelona board faces a very tricky stage right now. They need to show off financial muscles to encourage their transfer targets there is an exciting project. Yet, that will certainly open the eyes of current players agents to demand more. Dembele first, Araujo will follow.

This would in my opinion be a disaster of a signing. His injury record is sadly a reason why I hope that Spurs don’t sign him. One of the fastest players that I have seen play live for Borussia Dortmund and FC Barcelona. But he does not play enough to justify the transfer. https://t.co/Mt7uLij3YT

FC Barcelona won't make an offer for Noussair Mazraoui in January, but want to sign him for free in June. The Blaugranas want to do business with Mino Raiola, &amp; strengthen their relation, which would facilitate the signing of Norwegian wonderkid, Erling Haaland.

I understand ManCity frustration. And this is an honest tweet. Not only got slapped on the face because he moved to FC Barcelona, but they expected a lot from him. That's also why they descredit his quality now and call it "good business"
