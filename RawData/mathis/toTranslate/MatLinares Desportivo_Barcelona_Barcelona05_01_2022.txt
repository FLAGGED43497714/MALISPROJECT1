I was learning Pep Guardiola's methods to revolutionise FC Barcelona when he took over the job. Pep was inspired by the likes of Bielsa, Cryuff, and Michels. Working with graduates from La Maisa was one of his main strengths. And I think Xavi is currently following the same path.

Lost my last two games of the season but Barcelona B did similar and so FC Andorra have been promoted to the second division in Spain! https://t.co/kZR2BtYMmU



Happy with the Performance in the 1st half (Attacking wise). Defensive wise we can improve. Jutglà playing well as LW. Luke De Jong with the goal. Would Like to See Illas more in Action. Puig with Good pass Distribution.

FC Barcelona are interested in Alvaro Morata. Barca have had an interest in the player since May. 🇪🇸⤵️

They’re willing to offer Memphis Depay as part of a deal but Juventus do not want to let go of Morata. 
It is a very ‘difficult’ deal as of now.

Time to give my thoughts on the Ousmane Dembélé contract situation at FC Barcelona. After months of waiting, it looks like Dembélé will now leave on a free at the end of the season, after demands of a €40M annual gross salary with a €20M bonus to the player. Disgraceful. 🇫🇷 https://t.co/nrumRzEhYv
