We’re all Leeds aren’t we



We're experiencing the 𝙩𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩𝙚𝙨𝙩 Premier League title race in years 😳

Man City can go four points clear, for now, if they manage to beat a tricky Leeds side tonight..



👀 Leeds picked up four points off Man City last season, including a 2-1 victory at the Etihad... 

🔮 A repeat of this scoreline tonight will return a best price of 66/1, worst price 33/1.

In the lead up to this Leeds game, now is the perfect time to mention that Bamford is one of the most overrated players in the league, definition of a penalty merchant.



Pep mentioned Leeds play in a "unique way" and a way we are not used to, which is making us run constantly and not allowing us to control the game. The game at Elland Road last season was the perfect example. I hope Gundo starts as he is the one who brings control to our side.

Predictions GW17 (got 0 right last GW but that was only the warm-up):

Norwich v Villa 1-2
City v Leeds 3-0
Brighton v Wolves 0-1
Burnley v Watford 1-2
Palace v Southampton 3-1
Arsenal v West Ham 2-1
Leicester v Spurs 2-2
Chelsea v Everton 2-0
Liverpool v Newcastle 3-1



Mulling this one over for ages.

Risking it and going Jota as I think Newc are worse than Leeds and City are efficient but not free flowing like L'pool.

Biggest worry is waiting until Thurs for match as City game is defo on.

For obv reasons, today's game doesn't have great hype, but I feel today's gonna be a cracker of a game, a thrilling contest. If Leeds play like they did last year, this game could be the most intense this season alongside Liverpool 2-2.
the 1-1 last year was probably the best

A hymn. Could probably be presented. By anyone. To who? Well to City of course. Something really festive. Grand too. To ease their way against Leeds. City might not need it. They have their own melody. They know what there is to know. To win. To score. I love City. Got faith.⚽️💙

They also have decent odds on Klich so if he’s in the starting lineup somehow, we’ll add him in. If he’s subbed in during the game, also very likely to get booked as per last 2 games https://t.co/7nSFCJKDos



90th minute, Klich smashes it in! Own goal, he celebrates wildly and runs to the crestfallen Leeds fans. He rips off his top to reveal a vest with the words STOP ONLINE ABUSE  written on it. 
Everyone lives happily ever after. #MOT

All these nonsense fans should ask themselves this question, name the year your team first won the fa cup &amp; top flight league respectively!!! Almost all of you don’t beat  1904 &amp; 1937 esp Chelsea &amp; Leeds 😂😂😂 https://t.co/VZNiPDyx2j

I think City will win here but Leeds should make it difficult on them. 

Short rest and midweek match should influence this one. If Leeds score 1 were in the drivers seat to cash this. https://t.co/qBTNj1n0QM

“I’m at a loss. I’m really at a loss,” Leeds said. “I cannot think of any reasonable argument to justify a billion dollars going towards this stadium.”

#bbcfootball #PremierLeague @henrywinter If there was any doubt that Kavanagh was biased against Leeds, his report led to Leeds being charged by the FA, but nothing for Chelsea for doing exactly the same thing. Typical. https://t.co/8D4hZXt4cf

One of the things that drives me most mad about pro soccer is that EVERY time a ref awards a penalty he is surrounded, no matter how clear the infraction. Glad  they are clamping down, but why start with Leeds? Oh, I know, because they are not one of the "chosen" teams.#EPL #LUFC

The fa are charging us for players surrounding the ref? Are they joking? Every fucking team does this, leeds have very, very rarely done it under Bielsa..one of the only times we do, we get charged. Fa aren't fit for purpose.

I also happen to know a guy who put 11 past Bielsa but that's irrelevant.
