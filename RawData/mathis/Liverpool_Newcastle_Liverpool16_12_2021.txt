And so it begins for #LFC - but the game goes ahead tonight 🔴

https://t.co/U52ZuagvWa



Why Liverpool having to play tonight without VVD, Fabinho &amp; Jones when every other fucker allowed to cancel games.



Liverpool went from VVD &amp; co to COVVD real quick.



Fabinho missing Liverpool, interesting to see if Newcastle can exploit that

Today might be the last day we get to watch Liverpool play football  for a  long time 😔💔



10 mins until the teams are released, and unless Liverpool play their U15s I can’t see us getting anything at all, no offence u15s but I think we could maybe hold you to a draw. Can I get a bottle of Broon with a sparkler in please barkeep? @harlequinpub



This could be free hit time you know… typically you’d want to free hit in a DGW but in reality that’s only a 4/5 additional players because you can plan for it and likely to own some anyway. If we can’t get more than a few players (eg City or Liverpool called off) FH is great.

Betfair users! Recommend backing this odds boosted. Can see Liverpool winning the game in the first half really. Salah goal is always likely. Dominating Newcastle will most likely lead to the most corners. https://t.co/65k8qlzPtY

Personally think unfortunately it could be 5 or 6 tonight for Liverpool especially if their in the mood and we aren't at our best. Hope we don't get hammered though bad for confidence and goal difference. We need ASM who hasn't been good lately at his best Wilson and Almiron to.

Liverpool can’t afford to have any games postponed because I’d imagine the games would be rescheduled for between Jan 3rd and the 9th when we have the FA cup game and between the 9th to the 15th before we play Brentford during when the AFCON would be taking place.



Liverpool's game on or not?



hate to say it but tonight’s game between liverpool and Newcastle will probably be the last one for a while right? I mean schools are being closed left right and centre and games have already been called off, honestly won’t be surprised if this game gets called off too

Salah, Mane, Jota and Henderson will surely score tonight. Any others scorer would be a bonus though

Prediction.

A combined team put out jointly by #PGMOL, the #PL #PremierLeague, and #LFC will beat #NUFC 4-0.

Also looking forward to some very dodgy decisions going against us if Liverpool aren’t comfortable after half an hour.

#ESL #ProjectBigPicture #ProtectTheBigSix



It would be so Newcastle to beat Liverpool😂



When richer clubs like City or Liverpool win football matches in the premier league against poorer clubs. You don’t see English journalists immediately point out the wealth and quality gap between the teams straight after the game. In Scotland it happens almost every time.



In the last hour newcastle have gone from 20/1 to 25/1 against Liverpool if I hold off until the match starts I might get the same odds as Leicester to win the league  in 2015/16.

I love football and Liverpool, always have and always will, but you’re a loser if you can’t cope with the football being off for a few weeks/months. Go and discover other things in life or the opposite sex.

My #PremierLeague pick for tonight:

Liverpool-Newcastle➡️O 2.5➡️ 1.51 odd!
💡Liverp. scores 2.38 goals in average at home, while Newcastle concedes 2.13 away (average) and scores 1.06 (av.). I think over 70% probability of O 2.5!

Good luck! #bettingsports #sportsbettingpicks

Our game was the only one worth watching tonight to be honest.  Chelsea and Liverpool will hand out thrashings to their opposition without any issues.  It’s all becoming a bit shit imo.
