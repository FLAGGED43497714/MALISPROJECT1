Re January Transfers: 

I feel that Manchester United will only sell and will buy if an opportunity arises. Club will push only if Ragnick feels there is a need. 

As things stand, he has a good squad and can rotate. Summer most likely when club will look at midfielders.

When will Manchester United strip Maguire of his captaincy?? !!



Maguire Manchester United to follow suit...
Arsenal stripping Aubemeyang the captaincy, I know Ralf can do it to Maguire if he doesn't step up his game and his leadership role, as the the baby dull Ole don't have the balls.
#ManUtd #mulive #ARSWHU https://t.co/xQbanXTDeR



Without a doubt Arsenal are the worst run club in the Premier League.

Closely followed by Manchester United &amp; Everton.

Run terribly generally - spent £800m in 5 years and still lightyears from the top 3.

Shambolic club. https://t.co/i4twPtkZXq

The Manchester United postponement has really annoyed me

We had to play with 4 players testing positive 3 hours before the game and were told we couldn’t postpone it

It’s all or nothing.

Genuine question, how have Manchester United had their match vs Brentford postponed for COVID Cases but, Aston Villa who have also had cases still have to play their match vs Norwich?

Surely the risk is exactly the same, even if the number of cases is different?



42 cases in the Premier League, and Emma Raducanu too
https://t.co/TYLTII3iqi



So it was okey for Arsenal to play the opening first three games of the season without key first team players as a result of COVID but Tottenham and Manchester United cases is where they draw the line.



There's no surer sign of a looming lockdown than the Premier League cancelling games.
