So any reason why we had to fulfil the Brentford game with 3 players (I believe) out with Covid but Man U can get their game postponed,?



if anyone hears of 2 tickets going for the liverpool brentford game in jan please let me know



If Brighton game goes ahead on Saturday we should play Brentford instead on the saturday and play Brighton midweek as we’re both knocked out the cup. Southampton vs Brentford can be played later on when there’s no midweek fixtures or during champions league round of 16



I have De Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United and one defender from Brentford on my fantasy team yet I have got only 1 transfer available. This might be my last day in @OfficialFPL cup.

Of course the scoreline is actually #oufc 2 #bfc 3, sorry about that. Follow on the blog, it’s correct there:

https://t.co/4zk6IONrVr



Looking like we won’t know about the game until tomorrow morning, Brentford vs United was only postponed this morning...

Don’t be surprised, if the game goes ahead, at a reduced crowd - seems some don’t want to catch anything just before Christmas, which is understandable.



Manchester United will travel to Brentford this evening knowing that a victory would see them move into fourth position in the Premier League table.

It's Konfam!!

Disappointing the Brentford game isn’t going ahead but to be expected; giving the current club’s Covid situation. Even more disappointed in the way it’s been handled (mostly by PL).

Regardless, this could work out for the first-team (pending medical situations).

I hope all the people abusing Auba right now and pretending he’s the worst player in the squad aren’t going to include him in the list of 4 players who missed Brentford when they cry about FA bias and start their league tables from September

Manchester United vs Brentford is not going to happen due to Covid confirmed cases.. 😭😭😭😭 What do i do during that time???



Arteta has piled too much pressure on himself....Now he has to perform
And win games.
No way he takes such a bold decision then gets outplayed by Brentford.
He dug it himself deep enough.

Normally, my bench is Mbeumo-Dier-Brownhill. I'm considering upgrading Brownhill instead of Mbeumo this week to Bowen for fixture rotation and Covid security. 

However, the extra 1M could be useful, 3rd bench spot not always needed, and Brentford's fixtures turning poor. 🤔

With regards to the covid situation, I understand why the PL wanted out game v Brentford to go ahead. Having the opening game cancelled due to covid was going to be a very bad look.

It's good that Brentford game is shifted. We gonna get back Best French CB and Best Uruguayan CF back in our team. 🙌😍



Games that are off / rumoured to be:

Brighton vs Wolves  
Man City vs Leeds
Man United vs Brentford
Norwich vs Aston Villa

At this points it’s going to be a long day trying to figure out a team by taking as little hits as possible…

Also gives Ralf a proper few days of training once Carrington re-opens

I'm sorry, not downplaying the covid situation but Arsenal had 6 to 8 players out and still had to play Brentford with a depleted squad. All of a sudden, the premier league are postponing games now?? The biasness is real

I like Brentford. All clubs should try to be a bit more like Brentford. https://t.co/9mzKlqLpeQ

Already got so much yellow/orange/red in my team as it is, this is going to be a tough GW.

Brentford have recently had Toney and Sørensen out due to COVID, no postponements. 

However, the moment one of the most expensive and stacked squads in the league has a couple cases, a game can't go ahead.

Shambles.



Scared to play a Brentford side without Raya, Zanka, Ajer, Pinnock, Dasilva and with Toney likely on the bench🙄😂 https://t.co/Cc8BiiE0aI
