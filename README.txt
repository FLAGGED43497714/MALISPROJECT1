A betting bot that uses Elo ranking and Twitter. This is an improved version of the project Clubelo you can find in this github.

A description of this project can be found in ./"Final Project Report.pdf" 

The main algorithm is SGD/SGD_Assembly_Bet. 

You can choose the seed you want to test on by changing the path_file to odds_shuf,odds_shuf2,odds_shuf3 etc...

The date of the matchs can be checked on fichier_test_3.csv 

Some raw data can be found in /toM/, so you can check that the tweets were created before the match's begining.
